Glad I found the alternate entrance at the other end of the park to continue the search.  A neighbor nearby seemed interested in what I was doing, so I had to pretend to study tree leaves.  But I caught a break, retrieved the container, and went to a nearby picnic table to sign the log.  Nice location - thank for the hunt!</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;A new park! This is a quick multi-no puzzles or tricks. Just take a short walk to the first waypoint and get the coordinates for the final. Enjoy the park if you have time.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This is a multi-cache in memory of a family friend named Mikey. At an early age Mikey was sporting a moustache that earned him the awe of his peers. He was a wonderful young man and we want to remember him. We placed this cache in a park where children play, people walk the pathway and there is a variety of wildlife enjoying the wetland. If you can, take a minute to enjoy the vista over the field when the sun is setting, and the quiet grace of herons hunting in the pond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The waypoint is a cammo tube with the coordinates for the final on an index card. The final is a lock-n-lock with a little room for tradeables and trackables. Use your geo-sense for the final.&lt;/p&gt;
This cache was muggled and replaced on 8/10 at 6:30 PM. Please let me know asap if it is missing again. I may have to reconsider the final location.

   <groundspeak:short_description html="False">A short walk down the Ontario County Pathways from the parking lot on Ontario St. in Canandaigua will take you to this cache.  There is no need to go closer to the railroad tracks than the pathway goes.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The cache is on the side of the trail away from the railraod tracks.  THERE IS NO REASON TO GO NEAR THE TRACKS.  Stay on the safe and legal side of the pathway.

A little history:  In 1900 36 trains came through Canandaigua every day on the tracks near the trail, and the tracks that used to run on this rails-to-trials trail.  Now the train comes about twice a week.
   The property for the Ontario Pathways trail that you will be walking on was purcahsed from the Penn. Central railroad in 1994 after being abandoned for over 20 years.  They have cleared the entire completed portion of the trail to a width of 12 feet.  Currently 21 miles of the trail are open, and 2 more miles of trail are yet to be finished.  Unlike the railroads, the ontario pathway is a growing work in progress.
   The giant brick building across the railroad tracks from the parking is the old Lisk factory.  It was a major producer of stainless enamelware until it was closed in 1966.  Check out the information kisok in the parking lot for more history of the trail, railroads, and Lisk.

The cache:  Originally it contained a small TB, an FTF button, the first release of a new signature item of mine (bonus: can you tell me what it is and how it got like that?), one die, a logbook and pencils.  It could be quite difficult or very easy.  Make sure to REPLACE IT EXACTLY AS YOU FOUND IT!!!  Once again the cache is on the south side of the trail, away from the railroad tracks.  Be careful of the vegetation when searching for this cache.  Use the strength of your mind, not of your body, when finding this cache.  Log your DNFs!

You can continue on down the trail about 1 mile to find "Boars Nest" and about 2.5 miles to find D, W and S.

The parking lot is off of Ontario street not far west of the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

There’s peace and quiet, beauty and repose
It’s hidden in a valley beside a mountain stream
And lying there beside it
I find that I can dream "

Those are lyrics from a camp song we used to sing years ago and for some reason when I visit the small cemeteries, it always comes to mind. They may not be "hidden in a valley beside a mountain stream" but they are peaceful places to me.  I have enjoyed finding some of the small graveyards that others have brought me to while caching and I wanted to share a few of the ones I have found.

I go by this on my way to visit my mom in Canandaigua. It is listed as the Cooley Cemetery and there are only a few graves. Enjoy the quiet while you look for the cache.  Please do not search after dark.

Cache container is a small camo'd pill bottle. Please rehide it carefully. The grounds here seem well kept up and it could easily be discovered if left exposed. There was a pencil when I hid it but bring one to be sure.

Cache is on the side of the trail, you do not need to leave the trail to find.

Please note I had a +/- of 17 ft when I placed this cache...my PN-20 wouldnt get any more refined than that. If someone finds this, please post your cords if mine are to far off.

Please return the cache to the same position it was left in to avoid muggling.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Today we were on a mission on this our 2nd Annual Father/Daughter geo-day:  Battleships (we only got 14) and beat last year's record of 38 caches in a day.  CACHE GOAL:  40.   We started out doing some awesome caches on some cool trails, but by the time we made it to Canadaigua we were loosing steam as well as daylight.  I was only picking P&amp;Gs or we weren't going to make it.  

I saw this was close to the road, but after reading the hit/miss finds I figured we didn't have time for its possible difficulty level.  Dad saw it on his Garmin and said - let's do it!  Okay, dad . . . okay.  I'm really glad we did.  I had it in my hands after just a moment of careful thought.  

LOVED IT!  You earn one of our favorite points for the day.  I'm so glad we stopped.  Thanks for the fun.  

This was cache #34, btw.  And, oh - what's with the snails around here??!!</groundspeak:text>

Tried again on the way back but cell phone light in the pitch black wasn't cutting it.  Lol. But then we got distracted by a real neat tree frog. It was found earlier in the day too,  which makes it worse for us.  Lol. We'll return to find it later as well as the caches on the trail to the east.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Searched for some caches in the Canandaigua area after the Riesling festival.  Ran into a muggle who gave us a bit of interesting information about the trail.  This was a really clever hide!!  The hint was helpful.  Unfortunately we didn't have anything to replace the log.   Hopefully another geocacher will be able to replace it.  TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

I am over an hour away and just visiting the area for a while today. It was a real clever hide. It would have been a long search if not for Char1953's keen sense and the hint on this one.

Holy snails, batman!!  I think I saw more snails between the one we grabbed on the Pathway and here than I have the rest of my life combined.

This took us way longer than it should have.  I let dad clear an area and I shouldn't have been so trusting.  ;-)

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Cords posted are the trail head only.  Not the actual cache.  YOU MUST DO SEARCHING ON THE GEO-WEBSITE BEFORE DOING THIS CACHE!
  First jot down the trail head cords.  Then find the closest Benchmark nearest them. Once you have that, proceed to the find this very old style Benchmark. The area immediately around Benchmark can be slippery.  There are also thorns and vines growing up very near area. If you park in the church lot, you do NOT have to cross the road.  
  Once you found it, the cache is EXACTLY 53' on a magnectic bearing of 30 degrees.  North - north east from Benchmark.  If you can not figure this bearing, look in a circle 53' away!  Cache is a small LocK/Lock with cammo tape.  
 I enjoy Benchmarking almost a much as Geocaching.  This style is very old and few of these exist.  The are several along this path.  Another about 1 mile east, and one on the bridge just off County Rd 4 on the same path going west.    I hope you enjoy this.  Please look out for muggles walking and hide as good or better than found.  Do not leave it exposed to be found by others non cachers please!


Congradulations to 72CCT-ChE for another FTF!!!

Additional Waypoints</groundspeak:long_description>
    <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Look up my account under Benchmarks and see which one I found on March 26,2008  Lat and Long of Benchmarks are never deadon. Benchmark is on right side of trail as you walk to it in a cement head wall.  947 268 if you really need help.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I pass by here on my way to Geneva more times than I could ever count, and have always wanted to stop for this one.  I had already done my "homework" quite a while ago, and today was a perfect day to hopefully move this over into the found column.

Had a great walk on the nice trail and soon found myself in the general vicinity of the benchmark.  I tried the coords on the benchmark page first which took me to a spot that didn't match what I had read in previous logs.  On my way back to the trail I stumbled upon the cache.  Sweet!  Signed in and replaced as found.

Never did find the benchmark.  The more accurate coords provided by the CO pointed right into a patch of thick growth, so I decided to return some day in the fall when things have died back a little.  Never seen one of these bolt types, so I'd like to check it out.

Thanks for the fun puzzle and hide!</groundspeak:text>

I made plans to meet a group near here, but when I ended up car pooling, I left the benchmark coords in my car.  . . oops.  I had a pretty good idea what to look for from the pictures, and also because we found several similar benchmarks further down on the trail, but I used the PAF connection to confirm my suspicions.  We found the benchmark with ease, and then I made quick work of the final. . . last of the day.  Thanks for the fun.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This turned out to be harder than I thought. I dont know why I had so much confidence going in since I never have hunted a benchmark and dont know how to project waypoints. Anyway, I was planning on a few more caches down the trail but spent about 45 minutes searching. After carefully re-reading the benchmark and cache description I then found the mark and cache. Both were hidden well by the fresh fallen leaves. TFTC

PS, I was close to calling the lifeline given in the clue, but just as I was about to hit send, I remembered the C.O. was in Colorado and would not have appreciated a phone call at 430am his time. . .</groundspeak:text>

Blackbox was a game invented in the early 1970s by Eric Solomon. (He got his inspiration for the game from Godfrey Hounsfield, the British researcher who invented the CAT scanner.)  The game consists of sending "beams" into a square box via any of the 8 "ports" on each side.  One of three things can happen to the "beams".  They can:&lt;br /&gt;
- strike an "atom" directly and be absorbed&lt;br /&gt;
- glance off one or more atoms and be reflected back&lt;br /&gt;
- come out another port, possibly being reflected along the way&lt;br /&gt;
The objective is to deduce the locations of the atoms by the behavior of the beams.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can try playing the game &lt;a href="http://www.bibeault.org/blackbox/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Note that on this website, the atoms are referred to as "balls".&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If the above website is down or you want a further explanation, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Box_(game)"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is the wikipedia web page for the game.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To solve the puzzle, you'll have to find the atoms contained in two blackboxes based on the clues shown below.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I have actually had this one solved for a couple weeks now.  Had a lot of fun learning on the webpage, and then took my shot at the puzzle itself. Not as easy as my test run examples, but even more fun because I really had to think about it instead of just "asking" for another square to be filled in for me on the website games.  Soon enough, I had coords.  Planned on heading to do some caches in the general area today after breakfast, so MacCrew and I started here.  Very nicely laid out multi on a very neat trail, and we had no difficulty coming up with each hide. Thanks BB and DD, another great puzzle and equal quality hide!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Pep and I were heading down south this morning after breakfast and she had solved this last night, so this was our first stop. I vowed not to log it until I solved it, so got home, played the online version a few times and thought I'd give the cache puzzle a try. Easier than I thought it would be and I was pretty sure I had it, but got a "Sorry" from the GeoChecker. Hmm... As it turns out, I transposed 2 numbers when I wrote them down. Checked again and got the "Congratulations" message. Yay! So now I can "legally" log it. Enjoyed the walk along a trail I'd never been to before. Found all the waypoints with no problem, including the final. Thanks for a fun puzzle and tftc. :)</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">4th stop of the day on my puzzle run between Ithaca and Rochester in hopes of having the GeoRoc picnic event be cache #999 for me.  Everything worked out great and I had a lot of fun.  I enjoyed solving the puzzle when it came out, as it was a kind of logic puzzle I had never seen before.  I seem to remember it took me a little work to do it right, but that may be because I hadn't read the rules completely.  I was a little hesitant to tackle a 3 stage multi by myself, but had no problems at all.  Sometimes it seems my geopals make most of the finds when we go out, so it was encouraging for me to be able to do this one totally on my own.  Waypoint one had me grinning.  I understood the reference from having done &lt;a href="http://coord.info/GCX30K"&gt;this cache&lt;/a&gt; a while back, but didn't find exactly what I was expecting.  Waypoint two turned out to be very well camoed, but had it in hand before too long, and was off to waypoint three where I found the nicely hidden (and very large) black box.  Lots of nice swag in there, but I took/left nothing.  Signed in and was on my way. Thanks for another fun puzzle and cache.  [:)] P.S. Great meeting up with the CO's at the picnic!</groundspeak:text>

From there we made spectacular time on the rest of the cache, I dare say we would have won a race all the way to the final if this one was timed.  We had a great time and headed out pretty happy with the fun we had.  Thanks for the cache, it wa a great morning to be here.

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">This cache is located along the Ontario Pathways trail system. The terrain rating is for the distance from the given parking.&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Ontario Pathways is a well maintained trail that was an old railroad bed. As you walk or bike along the trial you will see remnants of this railroad bed including ties, bits of coal, culverts and even benchmarks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthracite is a hard compact variety of mineral coal that has a high luster. You may see some pieces of this along the trail at some places. When you are walking along this section of the trail you will cross some fairly new bridges. There are several places where you will see a lot of moss cover railroad ties or dead trees. Some deer trails cross the trails and you may also see some stumps of trees that were chewed down by beavers. There is also an Old Pin Style benchmark on the bridge nearby. See Related Web Page for details. You will be looking for a cylinder container about 2 inches diameter and 4 inches long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please bring you own pen or pencil.&lt;/p&gt;

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Ontario Pathways is a well maintained trail that was an old railroad bed. As you walk or bike along the trial you will see remnants of this railroad bed including ties, bits of coal, culverts and even benchmarks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are walking along this section of the trail you will cross some fairly new bridges. There are several places where you will see a lot of moss cover railroad ties or dead trees. Some deer trails cross the trails and you may also see some stumps of trees that were chewed down by beavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

There’s peace and quiet, beauty and repose
It’s hidden in a valley beside a mountain stream
And lying there beside it
I find that I can dream "

Those are lyrics from a camp song we used to sing years ago and for some reason when I visit the small cemeteries, it always comes to mind. They may not be "hidden in a valley beside a mountain stream" but they are peaceful places to me.  I have enjoyed finding some of the small graveyards that others have brought me to while caching and I wanted to share a few of the ones I have found.

This is one of the two I go by on my way to visit my mom in Canandaigua. It is listed as the Tilton or New Michigan Cemetery and there are only a few graves. Enjoy the quiet while you look for the cache.  Please do not search after dark.

Cache container is someplace between small and a micro. Please rehide it carefully. The grounds here seem well kept up and it could easily be discovered if left exposed. There was a pencil when I hid it but bring one to be sure.

The weather today was cool, with on and off rain,  Fast cache and dash while traveling through the general area.   . I would like to thank all the cache owners who kept these caches maintained for this trip full of smiles. especially ROCKY for keeping this cache available for everyone to experience. Caches that can be found are good caches! TN SLAMO</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache is placed along the Ontario Pathways. It is near the location of odhome’s  archived “Together” cache,  which had a unique container, but unfortunately it was muggled and archived.  So, to give this area a new cache, I have placed “Together Again”.  This new cache is a small cammoed lock and lock, but big enough for small trackables.  Park on Smith Rd. or Freshour Rd. Should be a nice walk along the pathways and an easy find.

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Seedling tribute cache for TheTilleyHat who recently celebrated the big 1,000! This cache was provided by The Pink Panthers for those that were the first few to find &lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=629b465e-8650-4644-9afa-e0584c3b104d&amp;amp;log=y&amp;amp;decrypt="&gt;GC2T573&lt;/a&gt;. Congratulations Tilley on a job well done!</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">TTH = The Tilley Hat. Not only is the Tilley Hat a great hat but the Tilley Hat is also a great cacher! I've run into Tilley on a few occasions in the field and recognized him right away due to the attire. Every time I see a Tilley Hat for sale somewhere I think of Tilley. While this started out with a matchstick container provided in tribute to TTH, it went missing and I had to replace the final with a bison tube. But TTH is still honored and has completed this cache...even if he did need a hint! ;) This is a short two part multi that will bring you to a small town park in Farmington, NY. I tried my hardest to obtain the best coordinates possible but you might find WP1 will keep you going around in circles while you search for the next clue. Please be careful on the terrain! Farmington Grove Park is open from 6am - 10pm daily. Please don't cache between 10pm - 6am! You may also find many small muggles in the area which may delay your find. You may enter the park on the East, North, West, and my personal favorite the South side of the park. The east side has a parking lot available. All the others may require parking along the road. If you park along the road make sure it doesn't conflict with seasonal snow removal parking regulations in place in Farmington. The park does have public rest rooms and a drinking fountain available but not for all hours that the park is open or during all seasons. Please bring your own pen/pencil for signing log. Congratulations to WAM86 on FTF!
&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
    <groundspeak:encoded_hints>WP1: You've a 1 in 6 shot of finding this on the first try. Take the path most worn (you don't have to get wet if there is water!). You are looking for a very strong computer hard drive magnet with the coords of WP2 written on both sides with a sharpie and covered with tape to make it last. You should be able to read in place without removal. But if you must remove the very strong magnet, please be careful putting it back and in the same orientation and location.

WP2: Hmmm. I think most adults could find this one. Others might need a boost. Please secure container well as sometimes water can pool here.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Finding the first one was easy but then I had problems with the location on the second one on my GPS! I couldn't sign it because the log didn't have a pencil and me neither (lesson learned) I will come back soon to do it. The only bad thing is that I'm a short woman and if it weren't for my husband I wouldn't have done it :) . Great experience :)</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Saw the "missing container" message. Just went and checked. Sure enough it was not in position. After a bit of looking I found it on the ground under the tree on the opposite side that it should have been about 2-3' away. Not sure how this new container could have "dropped" from the "pool". It is now back in a "pool" that might be a little smaller and a little lower to the ground. Let's see if that helps. You should be able to find upon your return to sign the log.

WP1 was in fact there. It was extremely snugly stuck on the metal. You should be able to read the coordinates without removal but if you do decide you need to get a better look please be careful you don't pinch your fingers and replace in the exact same orientation as it was before removal (with the metal protuding table up away from the metal so that you have something to grasp to pull off...otherwise nothing short of a screwdriver or something to pry it off with will help you)

WP2 was also there but in need of maintenance. The previous person to handle the bison tube placed it back in location upside down and water pooled there. The top was not very snug and water entered the tube water logging the "write in the rain" log as well as the sawed off golf pencil in there that had a broken lead. I've replaced the log with a new one of the same variety with #1 listed as "WAM86 FTF + 43 others 2nd Log" and the GC code of this cache. Overtightened tops ruin o-rings, under tightened once leak, I'm going to throw some plumbers tape on the threads under the o-ring to see it that helps at all. Please let me know if you find a soaked log again.</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">We were having so much fun hiding these caches, that we decided to do a couple more.

The cache is a small lock and lock, with some room for trackables.  Shouldn't be too difficult to find. Hope you enjoy the nice view from the cache. Just be careful during hunting season.

FTF gets a dollar coin. 

Another big congrats to Captain Jon for FTF!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">The weather in Rochester was overcast so we downloaded some sites in and around Canandaigua, hoping to see some sunshine. We were not disappointed, our stroll along the Ontario Pathways. 

We enjoyed this site, my wife who is "high challenged at 5'4.5" (and yes that half inch is important!),
spotted the deer stand, saw that it was "looking OVER" and climbed that rickety old ladder for a look.
Did she find the cache?  No Comment!  I will say she did not see any Deer - Oh Dear!

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Ontario Pathways is a well maintained trail that was an old railroad bed. As you walk along the trail you will see remnants of this railroad bed including ties, coals, culverts and even benchmarks. The cache you are looking for is a plastic Vitamin bottle about six inches long and three inches in diameter. The opening is only about two inches so there is room for small swag.&lt;br /&gt;
Depending on what time of the year you go, you may see HOMEW. If you don’t see HOMEW, you still will be able to get to the cache.&lt;br /&gt;
The original HOMEW and Replica both went missing.To see others like HOMEW, click &lt;a target="_ blank" href="http://californiabricksociety.com/index.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is located in Meeting House Park in the town of
Farmington. The park is on the northwest corner of the intersection
of County Road 28 and Shortsville Road.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Meeting House Park is a very small town park. It has a nice
stand of tall pine trees, a picnic table, and an upright stone
marker. The park is CLOSED from 10pm to 6am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache container is fairly small, so only the very tiniest of
trade items might fit. It has started out with a log book, pencil,
and a couple of very tiny trade items. I even managed to cram in a
little token for the first-to-find. PLEASE re-pack the cache
carefully as it's a tight fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is some historical information on the park:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The park was turned over to the town on July 4, 1976 as a part
of the 1976 national bicentennial observation. The stone marker was
originally located three miles north of its present location in the
park. In 1928 it was moved to the present location by the Herendeen

That is the first time I met up with another cacher.. I tried to ask natural but it's pretty obvious in this little park!

GPS was no help as its reliability is questionable at the best of times, add trees and its useless... but luckily i found it as i put my phone away for a final sweep of the area... guess i need to upgrade :) would be more fun with more accurate tools.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Had an interesting time along this section of trail. Found everything I was looking for eventually but they seemed to get tough in the middle. Should have known what I was looking for here but hadn't paid much attention to the hiders as I traveled down the trail.

Bounced around to a few likely hiding spots and finally got to the right area for finding the cache. Almost let the name through me from initial thoughts but found the first idea was the correct one.
 
Spotted the cache, signed in and replaced without seeing and muggles during my whole time on the trail.

Thanks for the stop.</groundspeak:text>

For anyone else looking, disregard the bit about the white mileage post being near by the cache unless you are talking relative on a very large scale. A great little walking track though that we really enjoyed.

There is a lot of deer and interesting birds out there, for example Cardinals, in the woods that you can &lt;br /&gt;
observe. When you are done with logging the cache, I highly recommand to take a nice walk through &lt;br /&gt;
the settlement. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The geocache is an easy find and also for beginners. Please don't forget to close the cache correctly. The cache was hidden with admission of the owner of the private property.</groundspeak:long_description>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">A nice flat walk along a wide path on an old railroad bed which is now the Ontario Pathways.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">As you walk or bike along this trail you will see remnants of the old railroad bed. Some chunks of cinder and coal can still be seen if you look down at the trail as you walk along. Maybe even an old spike in a tie. Enjoy the scenery and wildlife too as you make your way to the cache. Benchmark on the way to this cache at: N42 52.555 W077 12.327 Old pin style on south side of trail. (Where creek runs under the trail). See Related Web Page for more details.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A rail spike is a large nail with an offset head that is used to secure rails to railroad ties in the track. Robert Livingston Stevens is credited with the invention of the railroad spike, being first used in at least 1832. The most famous spike of all is the Golden Spike which is the ceremonial final spike driven to join the rails of the First Transcontinental Railroad across the United States on May 10, 1869. I don’t think you will see one of those along the old railroad bed though.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please obey private property signs along the trail. Please bring your own pen or pencil as the container is not big enough to have one.&lt;br /&gt;

Also look at some of the remnants of the railroad bed along the way. Traditionally wooden ties on the railroad bed were usually made from oak but today concrete is now widely used. Approximately 3000 ties are used per mile of railroad track. Now you will know why you may see piles of ties along the trail.&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Had started to head to this cache a month or so ago but ended up at the end of a dead end road.  Saw there was parking coordinates when reviewing things for today's trip and used them to my benefit. 

Took the walk to this cache while bypassing the earlier caches so that my walk back would be entertaining. My GPSr led me to the geotrail and then the fun began. Spotted the face and focused my search there. Slowly widened my search area and weaved my way around some poison ivy. Gave it another thought and came up with a nice idea that soon paid dividends!

Disturbed some ants at the final and produced a damp log. Didn't have any replacement paper with me but was able to sign the log. Made sure the top was secure on the cache so that hopefully the log doesn't get any damper.

Thanks for the nice walk, cool natural phenomenon, clever cache and helping finish off my August caching challenge!</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The winter of 2012 - 2013 was long and gray. We coped with the early winter of 2013 by turning our backs on it. Solving puzzle caches was a good way to keep warm and dry and entertained. Cache puzzles posed by sujojeepers and mcdurr in California and Bumble! in Massachusetts were particularly challenging and educational. Each puzzle we solved was based on a different cipher from this American Cryptogram Association list.

Now we want to share the fun with you by placing some ACA cipher caches in the Finger Lakes area. Good luck and have fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is not at the posted coordinates. You must solve the puzzle to get the coordinates. There are two one dollar gold coins for the first two solver/finders. Please bring your own pencil or pen.&lt;/p&gt;

So I solved this some time ago and just couldn't make it out this way.  I enjoyed the puzzle, although it took some time and work to get through. Thank God for Excel....

I asked my wife if she wanted to go for a walk since we had both been sick for a week and needed some fresh air.  So off we went.   About halfway to the cache we saw something coming out of the ground. When I saw it I decided to keep moving...fast.  My wife screamed and went into a panic. I thought I was going to have to carry her. I am not sure what they were, but they sure looked like the picture I attached. I have never seen them before and don't want to again!  The good thing is it was only a 30 ft section of trail that had the holes in the ground...

So we finally made it to GZ without any stings and I soon had the container. Signed in and headed back to the car.  I had taken a mental note of where are friends were and when we got to GZ2 I told my wife 'stay in the center and move fast'.  She did and we were home free!

This was a fun old school pencil/paper and brain puzzle.  I appreciate the time and effort you put into the puzzle and hide (yes, I like the spot you chose and I know why you chose it!).

Thanks for the brain exercise and the fun hike. Hopefully the cooler weather will knock those nasty bugs out of the way.

We may not be first to solve or first to find, however we (mostly jfw) eventually work our way to solving the puzzle, finding the cache and signing the log. This was our fourth stop on an epic DeltaDelta sign the log day. Thanks for the fun!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Third puzzle on my puzzle run between Ithaca and Rochester as part of my plan to hit cache #999 at the GeoRoc picnic tomorrow.  I had solved this one when it came out (I admit it, I used a tool to do the heavy lifting), and was looking forward to coming and making the finds.  As chief puzzle instigator over the winter, it is really gratifying to me to see these caches appear and see how much fun folks have been having doing all of them.  I'll try to get my act together to put out another one in Ithaca before long.  I had a very pleasant walk to the cache, and spotted it in the 2nd place I looked.  Signed in and was on my way to the next one.  Thanks for the puzzle and the cache! [:)]</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I attacked this puzzle from a multitude of directions, but with little results.  I put it away for a couple of days, and after a nudge, I attacked it again.  This time things seemed to fall into place.  I made a few rookie mistakes, but got back on track fairly quickly.  It was really fun to do a pencil and paper puzzle again.  I found it more satisfying than letting the computer solve the puzzle.

After that in a little while, she had the solution.  Today, we were headed out caching with the SilverFoxes, and this one was our main goal of the day.   We parked at the trail head, and had a nice walk down the trail.  A few mosquitoes we the only problem that we had buzzing in our ears.  Nice puzzle.

   <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This cache is along the Ontario Pathways trail.  It is not meant to be difficult, just fun.  A great place for walking, bike riding or even cross country skiing. Should be a nice adventure for the whole family. Trail is open from dawn to dusk.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Cache container is small, but larger than a film canister. Not much room for trackables. Bring your own pen or pencil. Should be winter accessible.

A word of caution: the trail narrows as it goes over a culvert at N42 52.663 W077 11.101, and there is a drop off.  Please watch your young children at this point. Otherwise this is a great walk for the whole family.

Parking at either of the crossroads.  Enjoy!

Congrats to Captain Jon for another FTF!

Discovered an area ripe with hiding spots. Started in my favorite spot and struck out. Widened my search area and tried avoiding patches of poison ivy. Struck out everywhere I looked. Reached out for any clues or hints in the logs and found nothing promising. Started over and noticed something where it didn't belong. On the ground of my favorite place laid the cache! Could tell from its design and the water in it that wasn't where it should be. Didn't have a dry log so marked the paper as best I could and replaced the cache above where it was found.

didn't exactly invent Florida, but he arguably did more to make it
a vacation destination than anyone else in history! He built
railroads around the state and fine hotels for people to stay in.
So what does that have to do with this cache? Well, Henry was born
here in Hopewell, and WP1 is a sign commemorating that fact. &lt;br /&gt;
Let A = the two digits of the Boy Scout Troup added together &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Head on over to WP2. Teenagers drinking beer are frequently the
cause of headstones toppled over in cemeteries, but not always!
Sometimes, unevenly settling soil causes stones to lean and finally
topple over. You will see several examples of this as you wander
around this cemetery. WP2 takes you to the monument for Hiram and
Lucy Ann. Even though the bottom section of this monument is a
massive stone, likely laid on top of a base of crushed gravel or
concrete, it is slowly tilting (as is another large monument next
to it). It is quite possible that within 100 years, this large
structure may be in pieces on the ground.&lt;br /&gt;
Let B = the first digit of the day of the month that Hiram died
in.&lt;br /&gt;
Let C = the numerical value of the month Lucy Ann died in.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Now take a short walk to WP3. On the way there, you may notice
several older stones that have been repaired or modified to reduce
the chance of breakage. WP3 is the headstone of Thomas Miles. This
stone has been repaired with a couple of iron straps. That's
working for now, but there are other examples nearby where similar
repairs have failed.&lt;br /&gt;
Let D = the numeric value of the month Thomas died in.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The final is located at:&lt;br /&gt;
N42 51.ACD W77 12.XAB &lt;br /&gt;
where X=C-A&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Daylight hours only! And please be respectful of the area.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">A perfect Sunday for some garage sale'n and caching!  We started out in our hometown of Batavia, then headed out to Henrietta and Rochester, and finished up in Canandaigua. 

We LOVE cemetery caches... especially cemetery multis! This is a very old cemetery and it was neat to read some of the unique names and the 1800 dates.  The various types of markers and methods to try to preserve them were neat.  

We didn't have any problems getting the info at the WPs, but can see why some have said that the WP3 could be difficult to see.  By the time we arrived at this cache, it was overcast and a few drops were falling from the sky, which may have helped the legibility of the stone.  The final was easily found, using some stealth, due to the person mowing their lawn across the street.  Signed and dropped.  TFTC!!</groundspeak:text>

As I approached the search area, dove in on a geotrail but found it didn't produce what I was looking for. Followed the GPSr slightly further to where it originally wanted me to be and was quickly rewarded by spotting the uncovered cache. Cache was in good shape. Signed in and replaced better than found.

Come to find out that the old cache got "McChewed On" and obviously became a home for small woodland creatures. Cache was replaced today and a new log book installed. 

* Please re-close the container well and return all contents to their stuff bags, in fear of future break-ins *

This place seems to be crowded only one time per year! It's a nice little niche with a great scene and a very short well groomed trail. 

The cache is a plastic container with items collected from McDonalds over the years! Feel free to exchange any small items you wish! I will try to keep it stocked over time. 

BUG LEVEL 5/5 ! Bring long pants and some spray if you plan to hang around!</groundspeak:long_description>

I didn't read the cache description and I'm not from the area, so when I read the name of this cache, I was McHungry and convinced myself this would be in a parking lot that would enable me to get a Big Mac.  Wow, was I wrong!   

Cache was in good shape, but holy geo-trail, batman!  I just realized while logging how old this cache is.  Good job keeping it alive!!  Took: Hello Kitty sticker; Left: Friendly Rock.   Thanks for the McFun.

Also of note:  The two TBs that are listed in the cache (Oliver Owl and Shuttle Bug), are obviously not in the cache.  You may already know this, but the cache owner has the ability to mark them as missing.</groundspeak:text>

Good caching to you.  Always play it safe, to geocache another day.

A word of caution: the trail narrows as it goes over a culvert at N42 52.663 W077 11.101, and there is a drop off. Please watch your young children at this point. Otherwise this is a great walk for the whole family.
 
Trail is open from dawn to dusk and would also be a good place for biking or cross country skiing. Or come and enjoy the hike.

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The coordinates bring you to the Payne Cemetery in the town of
Farmington. This small cemetery was the last resting place for
members of the Payne and Lapham families and was used between
roughly 1820 and 1875.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 You are looking for a micro approximately the size of a film can.
There is no reason to park on the highway, since a road leads into
the cemetery. Daylight hours only please. Naturally, be respectful
of the location.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please replace the cache exactly as you found it.&lt;br /&gt;

The container is a cammoed childproof pill container about 5 inches long and 2 inches in diameter. Please bring your own pencil or pen. Obey the trail rules and they are open from dawn to dusk.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Ontario Pathways purchased the abandoned railroad property from the Penn Central Corp. in 1994. It had been abandoned and neglected for over 20 years. The Ontario Pathways trail is built on these abandoned railroad beds and is well maintained.&lt;br /&gt;
Although the rails are no longer there you can still see remnants of what was once there. The trails are about 12 feet wide and various scenery can be seen along the way. Enjoy the walk and have a relaxing day just looking around at things where the trains once took people.&lt;/p&gt;

A word of caution: the trail narrows as it goes over a culvert at N42 52.663 W077 11.101, and there is a drop off. Please watch your young children at this point. Otherwise this is a great walk for the whole family.

Trail is open from dawn to dusk and would also be a good place for biking or cross country skiing.

Congrats to Potter Trekies for FTF!

Geo-Coins are a hobby of mine.  Some have Pirates, some have Nautical themes, some are puzzle solvers.  To get the sipher for this cache, you will have to find the coin I used to  come up with the puzzle.  The sipher in the coin description is not from the coin. You should be able to figure it easily.  Same theme or way to use the sipher is the same to set the coin up to use.

Congradulations to Bridgebum on the FTF!!!!

I was aiming for the event to be cache #999 and it all worked out great. [:D]  I had solved this puzzle a long time ago, but never been in the area before, so when deltadelta1 heard I was going to be out around here, he encouraged me to stop and do this cache.  I'm glad he did, as I enjoyed the nice walk in on the trail.  Saw a little bitty snake slither across the path, and a frog hopped by (I seem to notice more of these things when caching by myself!) Made the find without any trouble (loved the container) and was on to the next one.  Thanks for the puzzle and the cache! [:)]</groundspeak:text>

I'm usually a bit dubious about finding nanos in the woods but after such a fun puzzle, couldn't resist trying.  We were so glad we did!  Great puzzle - a bit a of a challenge but once we had the cache in hand we had to say we loved it all the way through.</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache takes you on a walking tour of part of the historic
village of Bloomfield, NY. It is an easy walk of approximately one
mile in length, virtually all on sidewalks. Although it does not
have you cross the busy highway, please be careful when crossing
local streets. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 The listed coordinates are suggested parking for this cache. 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="LongDescription"&gt;The historical information for this
cache is taken from a walking tour put together by the East
Bloomfield Historical Society. Please visit their &lt;a rel="nofollow"
href="http://ebhs1838.org/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; for further
information.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The first waypoint takes you to a historic marker. Let A be the
last two digits of the year that the French explorer La Salle
passed through the area. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 The second waypoint brings you to a pale green home. This house
was originally built by Philo Hamlin as a store in 1796. Let B be
the number of freestanding posts supporting the front porch.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 The next waypoint carries you to a location which was once known
as "The Farmers' Store". This Federal style brick building was
constructed between 1808 and 1812 by a group of local farmers as a
co-op store. Let C be the street address of the building. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 The final waypoint takes you to a beautiful Italianate home with
Gothic style barn constructed by Charles Page in 1870. Mr. Page was
a prosperous hops farmer. As you look at the home from the street,
notice the small barn behind and to the right of the home. This was
one of Mr. Page's hops barns. Let D be the number of windows in the
barn which face the street. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 The location of the final is: N42 53.XY W077 26.Z&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 where&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 X=D+4&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Y=A+2&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Z=C-B-8&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is a camouflaged decon container. It is on private
property, but we have permission to hide it there. But daylight
hours only please!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And finally, in keeping with the historic theme of this cache, the
FTF prize is an 1863 Patriotic Civil War Token. During the Civil
War, there was a shortage of circulated coins because of hoarding.
Private mints satisfied the need for one cent coins by creating
tokens that were put into circulation and treated, for a time, as
legitimate coinage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Congratulations to TazD for another FTF!</groundspeak:long_description>

I looked for thirty seconds and then got too uncomfortable and walked away. I will confirm my coordinates and maybe return some time in the future.

Apparently our math skills were numb that day beacuse our final location although plausible did not seem likely and since wewere looking in someone's yard, we opted to call it a day and move on. A helpful CO told us we were wrong and with that prodding we were able to calculate another set of coords. Checked the location out on Google Earth and we knew these were going to work based on our paying attention during the nice tour bridgebum took us on. Well we finally made it back this way today and made a quick find, on a much nicer day. Thanks for the help and the cache.</groundspeak:text>

Thanks for showing me a new area, I had a great time.  Cache is in great shape and what a nice spot!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I was up in town from southern Ontario for a weekend retreat, and while the rest of the guys went golfing, I and another went for a wonderful hike in the excruciating heat &amp; humidity! (where'd the forecast thunderstorm go?!)
Well on our little walk along the trail, we grabbed a few caches, including this one. Beautiful day to be out in nature. 

Oddly, we found the cache container, but it was entirely empty. We looked around gz for a while, thinking the log my have fallen out, or perhaps this was a decoy, but we found nothing else. It was most definitely a geocaching container. I took photos in case they're needed for verification. And unfortunately I didn't take along any replacement logs or bags, so it's back where I found it.

These &lt;a href="http://www.drivehq.com/file/df.aspx/publish/bridgebum/PublicFolder/Dominoes.pdf"&gt;dominoes&lt;/a&gt; are probably not like ones you're familiar with. Each is created by combining two MacMahon squares (See '&lt;a href="http://coord.info/GC3BXB4"&gt;Shuffling Squares&lt;/a&gt;'). Cut out the dominoes and assemble them to form a rectangle, making sure that edges of adjacent dominoes &lt;b&gt;ALWAYS&lt;/b&gt; match in color. When you're done, you should end up seeing six numbers, the top ones corresponding to ABC, and the bottom to XYZ.&lt;br /&gt;

Once again I found myself in a new area and really enjoying myself. Found the cache quickly and signed in.
 
Thanks for a fun puzzle and a nice cache location. It feels good to be finding some of these puzzles I have solved and getting them signed.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We really enjoyed solving this puzzle. Needed a cache today, so we headed this direction and decided to tackle it. We parked about one and a half mile from it and then enjoyed a very pleasant walk today. Yesterday's snow was still clinging to the branches which made for a wonderful, peaceful scene. By coming from the direction we chose, we needed to cross a little stream. At first it appeared to be frozen over, but I proved that wrong! After finding the cache, we found a better way back. Thanks for the fun, bridgebum.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Suzy solved another one! She is getting real good at this. I printed the sheet of dominoes and cut them out last night. I spend a few minutes shuffling them around and gave up. Later that evening Sue was proudly pointing at the solved puzzle.

I went out this morning to claim our latest prize, and the satellites were being creepy to me. I paused on the trail and started waving my GPS around. It's a good thing no one was around. It must have looked like I was blessing the forest. When I finally got a lock, I noticed I was only forty feet away. After a short search, I was signing the log. Thankfully there was a pencil in the cache. I forgot my pen again. [:o)]

Thanks again for another fun puzzle and geocache. By the way, did I mention that I cut out the dominoes?

Please do not try to remove the cache container. Just take the lid off. It is a cammoed match stick container.  Please bring your own pen or pencil.

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The Ontario Pathways trail is built on abandoned railroad beds. Although the rails are no longer here there are remnants of them along the Ontario Pathway.  I watched modern machinery replacing ties and rails a few years ago along some active lines but some things still had to be done by brute strength. I found out that these workers are still called Gandy Dancers but  machines do most of the work.
   Gandy dancer is a slang term used for early railroad workers who laid the rails and ties by hand.  There are various origins of the term Gandy dancers but it is still most popularly known as the men who did the difficult physical work of track maintenance under the direction of an overseer. There are lyrics and songs they sang as they worked to keep in cadence with handling the rails or driving the spikes. Read about Gandy dancers and as you walk along the trail try to picture the scene of crews laying the rails and singing the songs.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">The cache itself is in great shape.  This cache needs the EASY kind of maintenance - one you can do from the comfort of your own home.  We're just asking that you please update the coords on this cache.  The ones previous finders have given you are good:
N 42° 57.952 W 077° 13.707

Simply do a log entry (as if you have found a cache), but choose "update coordinates" as your type of log entry.  Easy as anything.   Then I would suggest doing a second log choosing "owner maintenance" and that will remove the red flag this entry of mine has put on your cache.  That's all there is to it!  Future finders = happy.

One more thought - If I had a container like that, I would be proud to call it a "regular" instead of a "size not chosen".  That you would do under "edit" near the top right of the cache page.  Some may be more apt to look for your cache if they know it has swag and TB potential.  Just a thought . . .

42 58.029 / W 077 22.654. You &lt;b&gt;will&lt;/b&gt; have to cross a creek
along the way. It is very shallow and easy to cross in the summer,
but may be impassable when the water is higher. &lt;b&gt;Please use good
judgement when deciding whether to cross it.&lt;/b&gt; You do not need to
cross the second creek as the cache is on the east side of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check out this exceptionally nice and detailed web site
about the Auburn Trail and all its sections [&lt;a href=

both sides by private property, please be respectful and stay on
the trail. Also, be careful walking this trail during hunting
season.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be careful not to be spotted by any nearby golfers.
That's part of the challenge of finding this cache. It's entirely
possible depending upon the direction you approach the cache
from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache's name comes from the fact that it started out life
stocked with tools of various sorts. Feel free to trade whatever
sort of items you like. I'll reload a few theme items whenever I do
maintenance on the cache. Signature items and travel bugs are
always welcome, of course!&lt;/p&gt;

By the time I found the cache I only had 4% (imagine crossing the stream in the pitch dark!!) so I quick exchanged my treasures and left without loging :( I had just enough time to run back to the gravel section of the trail guided by fireflies.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I was playing in a golf tournament this afternoon at a very nearby golf course, co I came out early to grab a cache or two.  I started here, and found all waypoints and the final quickly.  Very well done, I believe that this was my first journey on this section of the trail.
Thanks</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Got intrigued by this one when I started trying to get more non-traditional caches for a challenge.  Used to try to avoid multicaches but certain owners make them a great fun experience, including you.  Nice waypoints, and a nice straight walk.  Sure enough we saw walkers, joggers and 1 biker.  Thanks!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I was up in town from southern Ontario for a weekend retreat, and while the rest of the guys went golfing, I and another went for a wonderful hike in the excruciating heat &amp; humidity! (where'd the forecast thunderstorm go?!)
Well on our little walk along the trail, we grabbed a few caches, and decided to attempt this multi in the short amount of time we had. Beautiful day to be out in nature!

Unfortunately, while we got stage 1, 2, and 3, time ran short (and I thought I'd contracted some poison ivy having been wearing shorts and sandles for this stretch), and my thorough-as-possible search at the final location revealed no cache. I'm wondering if perhaps while the maintenance fixed stage 1, the final might have still been missing all along... Anyhow, next time I'm in the area (next year? hah) at least I've got the final ;)</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Papyrus" color="#000080" size="4"&gt;The cache lies in
Onanda Park, which is located on West Lake Road, 7 miles south of
Canandaigua. Onanda Park's history dates back to 1919, formerly
camps for the YWCA and Camp Good Days and Special Times. The park
consists of 80 acres including cabins, pavilions, playgrounds,
fishing access, a beach and upland hiking trails with great views
of the falls. The free parking area is reached by going up the
drive on the west side of the road opposite the main
entrance.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Papyrus" color="#000080" size="4"&gt;The trail to the
falls and the cache starts under the wooden sign "Upland Hiking
Trail" we recommend you follow the trail keeping to the right until
you reach the end of the trail. After finding the cache reward
yourself with a downhill return walk and views of the
falls.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Papyrus" size="4"&gt;&lt;font color="#000080"&gt;The cache
container is a 30 mm box packed full of trade items. It is well
hidden and in order for all cachers to have a good hunt&lt;/font&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This is a great cache and very well hidden.  We started our hike at the lower parking lot and were the only 2 people on the mountain.  The walk to the trail from the parking lot was steep, but once on the trail, it was much better.  There are some really nice resting stops if needed and some nice overlook points.  Once we reached the location of the cache, it took awhile for us to actually find it.  I had to look at a few pictures in order to find the cache and it still took a little while.  As a matter of fact, my wife and I had decided to head on back since it was getting late.  I decided to stop one more time at the location we initially thought it was near, and that is when I finally found it!

Very beautiful place with some wonderful scenery so be sure to take your camera.  Remember that the entire return trip is DOWN HILL!!!

It was getting close to lunch time and Mud Dancer, Grandzero, astryintheforest and I had been on the go since 7am.  We were hungry and tired, but upward we went.  The call of a cache drove us on.  We were rewarded with great views of the area and a new smiley.  Thanks for the adventure!</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;An excerpt from the entry on Captain Diana in &lt;u&gt;Wild and
Strange Women of New York&lt;/u&gt; by Terese Harrington and Drusilla
Howe, Comari Press, May 1998.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Diana Elsbeth Verhulst was born in New Amsterdam in
1634. She was the eldest of the seven daughters of Peter and Lina
Verhulst. Peter Verhulst worked for the Dutch West India Company as
a trader and fur merchant. He often traveled through the
territories and provinces that now overlie New York and
Pennsylvania trading for furs with the indigenous Native American
peoples. Following the wild call of her heart, Diana more than not
accompanied her father on these trading expeditions. As such, she
garned a list of uncommon skills: hunting and wilderness survival,
herbal medicine and lore, conversant in several Native American
languages, and a stunning knowledge of every waterway, lake, and
river in New York and Pennsylvania.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Diana, like her mother and sisters, had a deep and
unabiding love for all botanical pursuits. While traveling with her
father, she collected not only seeds and roots to bring back to her
mother and sisters but also collected plant and medicinal knowledge
from the people she and her father traded with. Diana's mother and
sisters used the plant material and knowledge Diana brought back to
grow plants and prepare medicines for the other Dutch colonists as
western-styled medicines and preparations were expensive and half a
world away. Lina and her daughters were highly valued members of
the community."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An exerpt from Roger Pickman's &lt;u&gt;Buccaneers of Western New
York&lt;/u&gt;, Golden Goblin Press, 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Captain Diana Elsbeth Verhulst was Western New York's
Grande Damme buccaneer. Her unconvential upbringing gave her an
intimate knowledge of the waterways in New York. Her pirating
career began as a privateer during the Anglo-Dutch Wars. She
commanded numerous different vessels that attacked English military
and merchant vessels throughout the New York and Pennsylvania
waterways.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Captain Diana one was of the most feared of the Western
New York pirates. What struck fear in the hearts of the European
captains most was that she crewed her ships with mainly the angered
and ill-treated First Nations peoples of the New England, Central
Atlantic, and Great Lakes regions. Her crew was fiercely loyal and
attacked with seemingly no fear. She and her crew were well-liked
and supported by the other First Nations peoples of the areas in
which she sailed -- often sharing the booty and goods from the
ships they attacked with these people.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Diana was noted for striking without warning and
disappearing back into the mists without a trace. Her most famous
attack was when she was captaining the ship White Hawk on the
waters of Canandaigua Lake. In the early hours of a misty October
morning she attacked the English ship Resolute near Squaw Island.
The survivors remember a mist-choked fall morning and an eerie
drumming sound rising up from the lake depths. On the heels of the
lake drums the White Hawk burst forth from the mists, cannons
blazing. On the third volley the powder magazine of the Resolute
was hit. The burned hulk of the Resolute is still visible on calm
mornings at the bottom of Canandaigua Lake."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK103Q1 - Parking&lt;br /&gt;N 42° 47.067 W 077° 18.935&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">"Found it" = *gasp* replaced the cache.   **ducks**

This has not be found for 9 months and maintenance was requested four months ago after four incredible experienced cachers all claimed DNFs.  So I figured my choice was 1) help or or 2) request archive.  I decided that the first approach was more cacher friendly, though my partner of the day, Raggedy Andy, was leery.  I take full responsibility, but it was a container he had in his geo-bag that saved the cache.   Part of my decision was based on the fact that this cache has been around since 2008?!  That seems to be a rarity, so let's keep it alive.

The cache is still a nano- but it is NOT magnetic.  It is well hidden and totally findable, though.

Thanks for the fun and Happy Caching!</groundspeak:text>

NO, no wait, that's not true.  We saw a tree completely coated with this insect shells.  Seriously!  My husband took one look at them and knew they were cicadas.  I learned the following (Wikipedia, of course):

"Cicadas live underground as nymphs for most of their lives . . . In the final nymphal instar, they construct an exit tunnel to the surface and emerge. They then molt (shed their skins) on a nearby plant for the last time and emerge as adults. The exuvia, or abandoned exoskeleton, remains, still clinging to the bark of trees."

They sure do!!!</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;em&gt;This cache plays an important role in assisting the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Landsat Program!  PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE DESCRIPTION BEFORE CHOOSING TO ATTEMPT THIS CACHE!  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache requests your participation with a NASA and USGS Citizen Science project. As with all geocaches, you are under no obligation to participate in the study to log this find. Choosing to contribute to this study will require you to take 6 photographs and answer a few simple questions. Should you decide not to participate in the study, you may still log the cache (but you won't be nearly as cool in my book.). Thanks for your understanding.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Landsat&lt;/strong&gt; represents the world's longest continuously acquired collection of space-based moderate-resolution land remote sensing data. Nearly four decades of imagery provides a unique resource for those who work in agriculture, geology, forestry, regional planning, education, mapping, and global change research. Landsat images are also invaluable for emergency response and disaster relief.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As a joint initiative between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and NASA, the Landsat Project and the data it collects support government, commercial, industrial, civilian, military, and educational communities throughout the United States and worldwide.  The Adopt-A-Pixel Program is being conducted by NASA, the U.S. Geological Survey, the NASA/USGS Landsat Team, and their partners:&lt;br /&gt;
·         4-H&lt;br /&gt;
·         The New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science&lt;br /&gt;
·         Bandelier National Monument, US National Park Service&lt;br /&gt;
·         Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail, US National Park Service&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The eighth and most recent Landsat Satellite was launched February 11, 2013.  Like its predecessors, this satellite will be providing images with 30-meter resolution, making a complete revolution of the earth approximately every 24 hours.  Each pixel on the image represents approximately 30m on the ground.  Pretty remarkable, considering these satellites are hundreds of miles above the earth.  It would be something similar to seeing three blades of grass from the other side of the football field!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Landsat Science Team has the job of understanding these data so they can know and tell other people exactly and specifically how our planet is changing over time.  For many reasons, the scientists need to check the satellite data with observations made by people on the ground in order to have the greatest possible confidence in the accuracy of their work. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That’s where you come in. Your observations can contribute significantly to the value of the satellite data for national and global agriculture, climate, disaster management, ecosystems and biodiversity energy, fire, forest management, human health, urban growth and more.&lt;br /&gt;
NASA and the USGS are inviting citizen scientists across the world to Adopt a Pixel.  So, I’ve created this geocache so that you can help NASA observe this 30m pixel of space on an ongoing basis!  While Geocaching has removed the “Additional Logging Requirements”, I am hoping that you will choose to help out (in addition to claiming your smiley!) this project by taking a few extra minutes to fill out the “Data Sheet” in the log book.&lt;br /&gt;
You will need to be able to take six pictures in order to complete the data sheet, so be sure to have some sort of a digital camera (cell phone camera, tablet camera, point and shoot, SLR, etc…) with you.  When you find the cache, use your camera to take the following images (be sure to take them in sequence:&lt;br /&gt;
·         One image, facing North&lt;br /&gt;
·         One image, facing East&lt;br /&gt;
·         One image, facing South&lt;br /&gt;
·         One image, facing West&lt;br /&gt;
·         One image, facing up to the sky&lt;br /&gt;
·         One image, facing down to the ground.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;There are some critical ground rules for these images:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Landscape Photos:&lt;/strong&gt;  Your photographs should be in landscape format, not in portrait (they should be longer than they are tall).  Views that are not too distant will be best (such as far off mountains).  At the same time, we will not be able to use close-ups such as tree trunks.  Somewhere in between is what we need.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Level:&lt;/strong&gt;  Make sure that your images are as level as you can.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;No People: &lt;/strong&gt; Please do not include any people in your photographs, unless they are unrecognizable. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Modifications: &lt;/strong&gt; Please do not modify your photographs in any way before submitting them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ownership:&lt;/strong&gt;  Once you have uploaded the pictures, they will become public domain.  Photographers should have no assumption of ownership.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Landsat Satellite Overpass: &lt;/strong&gt; Photographs taken at the same time as the Landsat Satellite is passing overhead will be particularly useful.  Typically, the satellite passes over this location at approximately 10:30am daily.  You can still participate, even if you find this cache at another time, but pictures taken around 10:30am are most useful for the scientists.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once you have taken these six images, please take a moment to fill in the Data Sheet which is provided inside the cache container.  It is a little more involved than a typical log sheet, but it won’t take any more than 5 minutes to help out NASA. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When you log this cache online, I will ask you to please email your six images to the cache owner (jah249@cornell.edu).  I will collect the images, and will periodically replace the log book.  I will submit all of the data and the images to NASA on a monthly basis. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

   <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This cache is in Case Cemetery in Bristol, NY. It is a TINY cemetery and you will miss it if you blink your eyes. It is located on private property and has been given permission by the owners. Please give a friendly wave if you happen to see them.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">In travelling about the world and exploring local cultures, I've always been amazed that we, as humans, hope to be remembered by raising elaborate monuments or markers above our graves. In many cases, the ravages of time and weather obliterate the carvings upon the stones and leave no indication of who lies beneath.

A CASE IN POINT is the Case family, early settlers of Bristol in the 1800's, who were buried in a cemetery that bears their name. Of the 8 recorded burials, only a couple of grave markers are still legible, James Case and his wife Betsy. As to the others, who knows? If you explore further, you'll find nondescript stone markers of at least 5 more.

The cache is a 2 quart cammo-painted plastic jar with a screw lid. The cache is NOT close to any gravestone, so please respect the site and DON'T search around them! Visit the site, grab the cache, say a word of thanks to our forebearers and respectfully depart.</groundspeak:long_description>

This is about a 1.5 mile round trip hike from the parking coords.   Its a nice flat hike through an open apple orchard and part of the Victor Hiking Trails system.

From the parking coords go North of the building and follow the yellow blazes and victor hiking trail signs.

On the hill to your right after a bit is where we thought we saw a coyote.  We're not sure what it was, but Barkley went crazy when he picked up the scent.

My son helped place this decon and it should be an easy find.  I believe the trail splits past where we put the cache, and there is another cache just past it aways.

There is a Chilehead coin for FTF.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I've driven by the apple farm a number of times but never stopped.  This morning that finally changed.  What a great place this is to go caching!  The only thing I regret is that I didn't choose a better day to experience this one.  (Doh!)

I stopped in the building first to buy a cup of coffee before I set off down the trail.  The wind definitely reminded me that winter is on its way, but I still had a great walk regardless.  Enjoyed the views of the orchard despite the gray skies and the rain, and was soon at GZ.  Absolutely no problem finding the cache (which is in great shape), and I was quickly signed in and on my way back to the car.

Thanks for putting this one out there and for pointing out this spot to me.  I will be back again to explore on a nicer day!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was a real treat today.  Perfect day to go hiking in an apple orchard, surprised this doesn't get more action, especially in the fall.  Didn't know how to get on the trail, so appreciated the instructions in the writeup, they helped.  Also chatted with a worker, told him I was a hiker, he said he didn't really like to hike but liked to geocache.  What a nice coincidence!  He knew about the cache and described how I'd go, the same way as his wagon rides.  Well I resisted the urge to take that.  Did this on a day we read about bobcats in the area.  We have seen coyotes, and were sure, but once in the Buffalo area had an 'I think I saw' moment with a bobcat.  Cache was an easy find laying on the ground, I tried to place it more how I thought was right, right in the same area.  Thanks for a fun experience.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="green"&gt;-Have you ever picked up a trackable that has been in one area for too long?&lt;br /&gt;
-Do you have a trackable that has not been to any southern states?&lt;br /&gt;
-Would you like your trackable to take an epic journey?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="orange"&gt;If so, Then you have found the right place. Wormholes are shortcuts, connecting distance points in space and time. You have just found our end of the Wormhole that transports your coins and bugs directly to a cache in North or South Carolina. Our cache in NY works in conjunction with two Wormhole caches (1 in NC and 1 in SC - both located at Welcome Centers on opposite sides of the same highway) to transport trackables back and forth other through the wormhole. Here are links to the other ends of the wormhole (N.C.- &lt;a href="http://coord.info/GC3PGFC" target="_blank"&gt;GC3PGFC&lt;/a&gt; and S.C.- &lt;a href="http://coord.info/GC3PP5K" target="_blank"&gt;GC3PP5K&lt;/a&gt;). We liked the cache containers so much we used the same ones for each end of the wormhole.....If you would like your trackables to take a journey out of town simply place them inside this cache.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;Our guidelines for these caches are:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1.) The wormhole is a one way ticket for ALL trackables placed in this cache. Once dropped, it will travel through the wormhole and come out the other end in a cache somewhere in North Carolina or South Carolina. **Each trackable will be dipped in one of the two wormhole caches at the other end so it formally records going through the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2.) We check the caches weekly to make sure the trackables move fast through the wormhole. We devised a system for the "transport" that has been tested and is very reliable.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3.) Please remember to log the trackables you drop as soon as possible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="red"&gt;**PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE ANY TRACKABLES FROM THIS CACHE!!......If you DO NOT want your trackable to travel Southbound DO NOT drop it in this cache.**&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="green"&gt;This cache is located close to a Park-N-Ride Lot just OFF The New York State Thruway. Northbound and Southbound traffic from the Thruway can access this cache quickly by getting off at EXIT #44. Parking coordinates have been provided. If not traveling via the Thruway you can come from several directions, Loomis Road, Plastermill Road, or Rochester Road.(RTE. #332)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This area can become very busy at times so please be aware of muggles. Use stealth BEFORE and AFTER searching for this cache. The container has a logbook, pens, and can obviously hold trackables.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
**DIRECTIONS FOR OPENING &amp;amp; CLOSING THE CACHE: Please make sure to close the cache tightly and secure it with the lock provided. The latches work smallest to biggest and vise versa when opening and closing the container. To open the lock you must line up the combination with the name written in black lettering on the lock. The combination must remain in place for the lock to close. After you close the lock, PLEASE spin the combination so the lock stays locked. We have taken great care so this cache will remain at its location, please do the same. We know there have been issues in the area with caches, that's also why we made this a "premium member only cache".&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Congrats goes out to: StrivingforCamelot on his FTF&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As always we name our caches after song titles. "Southbound" is one of our favorite songs from a incredible band we both love, "The Allman Brothers".&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Watchout for an influx of southern state trackables in the area, they just might have come through this wormhole.....&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
*A special thanks goes out to Blaze for all his help, and to "The Band of Cachers" who have graciously accepted us as Charter members of the New York Chapter.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Parked in the nearby area and headed into the cache.    It was any easy find, but unfortuanately (for the cache) the lock was broken and I could access the logbook without a problem.    There were no TBs in the enclosed container either, even though someone has dropped one off in the last week or so.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Spotted this cache while on my way to Keuka Lake. Parked nearby and looked at what my challenge was and decided to save it for a different day due to time constraints and the footwear I had.

Kept this in mind during my return trip after a day and a half of fun and sun. Was better geared for the adventure. Never found the 'best' way in. Worked my way through several nice patches of poison ivy on my way to the search area. When I did get there, the effort was worth it. Can't say as I've crossed paths with a container quite like this one! [;)]

Struggled a bit with the first challenge and finally got to the log after donating a significant amount of blood to the mosquitoes. They were definitely out in force after all the rain we have been getting. Signed in and donated more blood while trying to re-secure everything as found.

Thanks for the interesting container and for the final cache of my day!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Greetings!

I noticed that your cache has the needs maintenance attribute set.  This is generally caused when a cacher posts a "needs maintenance log on  your cache for a number of reasons.  If you have addressed the issue or believe there is no issue, you can remove this attribute by posting an "owner maintenance" log, or editing the attribute list to remove it (note on caches other than traditional, the needs maintenance icon does not show, but clicking "Update Attributes" will clear it anyway.)

Often people will filter out caches that require maintenance so making sure this is correct will help cachers find your cache.

If you haven't addressed the issue, go out and find a few caches and fix this one on the way back!  [:)]

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Find #11 for me today.  I had been walking along the Auburn Trail looking for another cache nearby and saw a small sign pointing to a back entrance for the Municipal Park in a residential neighborhood.  Decided to try going in from there -- it was a good hunch.  Found a trail into this cache right away.  The lid of your decon container is broken, but a previous cacher has put it into a couple of zipper baggies so it is nice and dry inside. As I headed over to find the other cache here, I was so happy to see the nice new pavillion where I could refill my depleated water backpack -- it was a scorcher today.

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">In thinking of the caches I like the best they fall into a few
categories - sometimes it's the challenge of the find, sometimes
it's the nice long walk in the woods and sometimes it's just going
to an interesting place. This is the latter.
&lt;p&gt;This is an easy walk along one of the Victor Hiking Trails. As
always, the length is dependent on where you end up parking. Once
you get to the cache you have pretty scene with a view of what the
cache is named after. Makes for a very nice photo op IMHO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache itself is decon container with a few small trade
items. You will need to bring our own pen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FTF gets a pin that I recently got at a NATO event in Norfolk. I
think it's pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">In November 2008, Captain Jon found a USGS Benchmark. That
alone&lt;br /&gt;
isn't such a big deal, but THIS Benchmark was different. This
was&lt;br /&gt;
Jon's 100th Benchmark. There aren't a lot of people who spend a
lot&lt;br /&gt;
of time looking for Benchmarks, so Jon's achievement is
notable.&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is placed in recognition of this achievement.&lt;br /&gt;
Congratulations, Captain!</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is based on &lt;strong&gt;Benchmarks&lt;/strong&gt;.There are three
stages to this cache, representing three different types of Marks.
These are NOT official Marks, but are replicas of these markers.
There are many different types of marks, and the following
(summarized) rundown is provided on the Geocaching webpage:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;A benchmark&lt;/b&gt; is a point whose position is known to a
high degree of accuracy and is normally marked in some way. The
marker is often a metal disk made for this purpose, but it can also
be a church spire, a radio tower, a mark chiseled into stone, or a
metal rod driven into the ground. Over two centuries or so, many
other objects of greater or lesser permanence have been used.
Benchmarks can be found at various locations all over the United
States. They are used by land surveyors, builders and engineers,
map makers, and other professionals who need an accurate answer to
the question, "Where?" Many of these markers are part of the
geodetic control network (technically known as the National Spatial
Reference System, or NSRS) created and maintained by NOAA's
National Geodetic Survey (NGS).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt; 
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Kinds of Benchmarks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 Benchmarks can be divided into two general groups. The first
group, "vertical control points" are objects that mark a very
precise elevation above the standard datum plane (usually referred
to as elevation "above sea level"). The second group are the
"horizontal control points" - objects with precisely established
latitude and longitude. At this point, we should explain that
"benchmark" is a generic term that is used here at Geocaching.com
to refer to all geodetic control points. In the surveying
profession, however, the term bench mark (usually two words) is
used specifically for points of known elevation, or vertical
control. When the benchmark is established at known latitude and
longitude, it is described as horizontal control. The generic terms
favored by professionals to describe horizontal control are station
or mark, rather than "benchmark".&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Vertical Control Marks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
These are the true "bench marks". Generally the words BENCH MARK
will be printed on them near their rim if the mark is the disk
type. Many vertical control marks are not the disk type, however,
and can include bolts, rivets, chiseled squares, chiseled crosses,
etc.&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Horizontal Control Marks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There are several types of horizontal control marks. They differ by
which kind of horizontal control system was used in establishing
them and the amount of precision they represent. Most horizontal
control marks are marked with a disk, but some are other types such
as a chiseled cross, bolt, drill hole, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;Intersection Stations&lt;/b&gt; (a Type of Horizontal Control)&lt;br /&gt;
An intersection station is a prominent landmark, such as a water
tower, radio tower, church spire, mountain top, or any other type
of object that can be observed from a distance. These kinds of
"large object" station markers, known as intersection stations
because of the way their coordinates are calculated are usually
landmarks higher in the air than any surrounding objects, which
allows them to be seen from many miles away in several directions.
By observing one or more such points through a telescope, surveyors
can determine positions on the surface of the Earth through the use
of trigonometry.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Triangulation Stations&lt;/b&gt; (a Type of Horizontal Control)&lt;br /&gt;
A triangulation station is usually a metal disk with a small
triangle in its center Generally the words TRIANGULATION STATION
will be printed on them near their rim. Its position has been
determined by measuring distances and angles from other stations.
Triangulation stations, also called tri-stations, are typically
associated with nearby reference mark disks and an azimuth mark
disk. More about that below.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;Other Types of Horizontal Control&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;There are several
other types horizontal control marks. These include traverse
stations, trilateration stations, and GPS stations and often those
words are printed around their rim. Generally these horizontal
control marks are not associated with reference marks or azimuth
marks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Reference Marks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 Triangulation stations usually have two or more reference marks
associated with them. Reference marks are for helping to keep the
location of triangulation stations from being lost and are not
actually geodetic control marks. The triangulation station's
description has accurate azimuth and horizontal (not slope)
distance to each of its reference marks so that it can be re-set
from them if necessary. These marks also have arrows in their
centers that are supposed to point toward the triangulation
station. A few reference marks are surveyed with adjusted
coordinates and have their own PID in the database.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Azimuth Marks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 An azimuth mark, together with its associated triangulation
station, provides an accurate azimuth (like a compass direction)
that is based on true North rather than magnetic North. This
azimuth is used to orient local traverse surveys. These marks also
have arrows in their centers that are supposed to point toward the
triangulation station.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;Cadastral Marks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 Some disks that look like benchmarks exist principally to mark
land boundaries. These marks, called cadastral marks, are actually
not vertical or horizontal control (geodetic) marks. However, some
of these marks are in the database because surveyors have made use
of them for geodetic control purposes without having to monument a
new benchmark in the area.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The hike is about 1 mile round trip, on railroad grade.
The&lt;br /&gt;
higher terrain rating is based on the immediate terrain around
each&lt;br /&gt;
waypoint.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well we had tried this one exactly 2 months ago. That day was a very cold and windy one and although we found WP1, we struck out on WP2. We were caching in the area today and drove right by here. It always annoys me to see the cache icon on my Nuvi, especially ones that we have DNF'ed, so we HAD to stop and try again. It was a very nice afternoon so we knew we would not have weather as our excuse this time! We made our way to where we had left off before, spent a good(?) 30 minutes looking everywhere but still not making the find. 
We really hate it when we are consistent with our inability to find a cache so we decided to see if we could use our geosense and the info as to how long the round trip is to find the final without the coords. It was such a nice day that we did not mind the walk and even though there were LOTS of promising hiding spots - and we checked most of them - we eventually found what we were looking for!!
It's better to be lucky than good. Especially if it results in a smilie. So at least the cache won't show up on the car's GPSr as we drive by, even though I will still wonder what we missed at WP2. TFTC</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">My husband let me pick an activity today, since it was Mother's Day. Of course Geocaching is always on my agenda. But as a fair compromise to him, since he is not a big caching fan, I suggested mixing a bicycle ride with caching.  This trail with it's cache saturation caught my eye.  I didn't really plan on doing this multi, I was caching with the driod and had left the GPSr in the car.  But when we found ourselves so close I decided to give it a try.  The driod was pretty jumpy at stage 1 but I found it without too much trouble. But then I could not figure out how to enter coords in the driod. M tried too, with no success. So I decided to give up.  We headed back down the trail and happened upon a spot that I though was perfect for a cache. It didn't take too much looking and I came up with this final. Go geosense!</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This cache is located in Harlan Fisher Park. The primary entrance is located off Lynaugh Road and tucked in between residential homes, be careful not to miss it.  The park has picnic tables, a playground and trails to enjoy.  Please be aware the park is open dust to dawn.  However, it recently under went a renovation and the entrance gate has been intermittently closed.  You can park and attempt this cache regardless of the gate opened or closed.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">We name all our caches after song titles.  This one is an oldie but a goodie from the band "The Yardbirds".  They were part of the British 60's rock invasion and had a few members in the band that went on to become  very famous.  You might recognize a young Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck from the background picture we posted. 






Things To Remember:

-The cache is located in the park, please respect the neighboring private properties.

-Loud Dogs Barking:  Do not be alarmed by this, yes we know they are there and yes they do make noise...

-Please take great care in replacing the cache EXACTLY as you found it.

-Container only holds a logbook and room for very small trade items.  You MUST bring your own pen to sign log.

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache will take you to the Dryer Road Park / Fort Hill area in Victor. The coordinates shown are for the highest point on Fort Hill. They have nothing to do with the cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Imagine that you're standing on Fort Hill. Let's say you've got a slingshot, you find an appropriate stone, and you fire it south toward Rt. 41. Your assistant (you did bring one with you, didn't you?) video records this moment and calculates that you fired the stone at an initial speed of 145 feet/second at an angle of 48 degrees above the horizon. He or she also determines that the stone landed at a point 140 vertical feet below it's starting point. Assuming no air resistance (and a gravitational constant&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt; of 32 feet per second per second), you will need to find two numbers:&lt;br /&gt;
t = the time (in seconds) the stone was in the air&lt;br /&gt;
d = the horizontal distance (in feet) the stone travels before hitting the ground&lt;br /&gt;
Once you have those numbers, the cache can be found at&lt;br /&gt;
N42 57.X W077 26.Y where&lt;br /&gt;
X = 7504/t (rounded to the nearest integer) and&lt;br /&gt;
Y = d/2 (rounded to the nearest integer)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now, don't you wish you stayed awake during that high school physics class?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is quite near an existing trail. But be careful when leaving the trail, as we've seen old barbed wire in several places, including near the cache!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dryer Road Park is open from dawn to dusk. Please do not attempt this cache during other hours.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt; if you use 9.8 meters/sec/sec instead, Evince will still verify, but you'll be roughly 35 feet off.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://evince.locusprime.net/cgi-bin/index.cgi?q=Gp3h1E3PfQKE92xSgDR-Snx1vLB283xNIuA"&gt;&lt;img src="http://evince.locusprime.net/images/evince-logo_sm.png" border="0" alt="Click to verify coordinates" title="Click to verify coordinates" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We were going to give a slingshot as a FTF prize, but we were concerned you'd hurt yourself (or someone else). So instead the FTF prize is a "Flingshot Flying Cow". Way better!&lt;br /&gt;

I have looked at this one at different times ever since we started caching and just had no luck.  Physics is definitely not my strong suit.  After taking a peek at the hint, and stumbling with a few mistakes, I eventually had the congrats on the geochecker.  This was the only cache not completed in our 20 closest to home.  So happy to have it solved.  We went out with the 5Cs today to make the find.  What a workout!  It was all well worth it.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">My wife finally figured out how to solve this one, but apparently not well enough to explain it to me. Oh well. Today we arrived at GZ and after 5 minutes of searching and a muggle and her dog approaching, we decided to move on, expecting to need to DNF this one. But when we got back, and no one around, we gave it another try and managed to find the well hidden coords. We still had some time, so we headed to the final and like many others, took the bad approach to the final. The fresh snow made it a bit tougher to find but not too bad. TFTC</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Fantastic and challenging puzzle!  Took a bit to solve but I came up with an 'easy' way.  This was on my to do list today so off I went.  Had problems at WP1 but finally got it.

Took the very hard way to the final(found the easy way on the way out).  Made the find and discovered no log. I carry extras in baggies so I signed and added it to the container.  It is small and looks out of place, but it's a log.

As we approached the final, we realized some boys were playing at the GZ.  I was tying to figure out if I could get a picture of the cache without giving away the location, when one boy spotted me and asked if I was geocaching.  He said the container was supposed to be "there" but it had come detached a few weeks ago.  He handed it to me as I crawled through the prickers.  There is a much easier approach. . . oops.  I will send the CO a picture of where I left the container. . . it was within 18' of the coords.</groundspeak:text>

BLUES" - Geocaching Series&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;The cache is
starting off with a log book,pencil, and is large enough to hold
trackables. Parking is available and even though the sometimes the
gate is closed you can still park and walk in.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;This is the
fourth cache in our "Don't Get The Blues" - (DGTB) series. The
theme is very simple. In this area, winter caching can become quite
unnerving at times, and leave you with "The Blues". This series of
caches has been designed to allow everyone to find caches during
the winter months and not leave you "Feeling the Blues"&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The
only rules that you must remember are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The
caches are all winter accessible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The
cache title will begin with DGTB - and have a song title with
"Blue" in it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The
cache can be found regardless if there is 3ft. of snow or no snow
at all.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;Every cache
will present it's own challenges as to how it will be found...some
will be quite easy, others will be harder....In the end we hope
this will sustain everyone through the winter months until the
frost breaks.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;As always we
name our caches after song titles. "Bullet the Blue Sky" by U2 had
to make the list. Its such a great song from one of our favorite
bands.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;This cache is
located in Harlan Fisher Park and depending on the time of year, it
can get wet and muddy...wear boots.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;For the FTF we
have left a FTF Banner.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Thought about not attempting but when the GPS read less than 200 feet I just couldn't resist!  Bushwhacked my way in via the not-obvious path and found the cache, chuckling and thinking all the way that I must be nuts!  Found the container and signed in. Then used the deer path to get out, which took me to the muddy area that I was trying to avoid initially.  By then I just wanted out, so went for it.  Those sneakers that I just hosed down from a prior adventure are in need again.

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="14" color="blue"&gt;"DON'T GET THE
BLUES" - Geocaching Series&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;The cache is
starting off with a log book and a pencil. The container is large
enough to hold trackables. Park in the adjacent parking and begin
your search.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;I must give all
the credit to the creation of this cache series to my
wife.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;This is the
first cache in our "Don't Get The Blues" - (DGTB) series. The theme
is very simple. In this area, winter caching can become quite
unnerving at times, and leave you with "The Blues". This series of
caches has been designed to allow everyone to find caches during
the winter months and not leave you "Feeling the Blues"&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The
only rules that you must remember are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The
caches are all winter accessible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The
cache title will begin with DGTB - and have a song title with
"Blue" in it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The
cache can be found regardless if there is 3ft. of snow or no snow
at all.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;Every cache
will present it's own challenges as to how it will be found...some
will be quite easy, others will be harder....In the end we hope
this will sustain everyone through the winter months until the
frost breaks.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;As always we name
our caches after song titles. "Tangled Up In Blue" is the third
cache in this series and seems appropriate for this crossword
puzzle cache.&lt;/font&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Great cache! I had fun with the puzzle and I have to say I really enjoyed the hide. As soon as I hiked in to GZ I saw what needed to be done.  This was very creative and I love creative caches!

Thanks for being a part of a great day out caching. I took some time today to grab some caches I have been meaning to get and also grabbed a few puzzle caches I solved long ago and never grabbed. Feels god to have this one done. 

Log was a bit damp but I had no problems signing it.  In this heat it will probably dry right up. I couldn't believe how hot it was today.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well after trying to get to my next milestone for the past month, today was the day. Had worked on this puzzle for a long time and had finally solved it but with a bad knee wasn't able to do any geocaching for awhile. Received a cortizone injection so with the knee strengthened, off we went. Only needed one before making this puzzle the 13,000th find. SUCCESS! GOAL ACHIEVED! Now the schedule the knee replacement. Thanks for the cache even though I don't like puzzles.

Really, I was hoping it would be along my commute as I was starting to get low on calendar-filling fodder. Had to guess on a couple names but after a bit was rewarded with coords.

I scoped the area out on a couple recent drive-bys, and stopped in this morning on my way to work to fill my square. I thought I spotted it from afar, but parked as I'd planned anyway just in case I needed the extra cover. Turns out I was right the first time. No muggles at 10 til 8 in the AM &amp; I was able to quickly make the grab, sign &amp; replace. TFTH!</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Cache is NOT at the posted coordinates, but is within a two mile radius.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;During the April 2013 CITO event, momd, Mud Dancer and spooko13 teamed up near the golf club's driving range at Genesee Valley Park. While we didn't find a lot of typical trash, we did find lots of golf balls! Lots and lots and lots and lots of golf balls.... Many were chewed up by the lawn mower and thrown into the woods, but many more were usable. So we discussed what to do with some of them, and like any good geocachers we came to the only logical conclusion....use them as part of a series of golf-themed hides!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series consists of three traditional hides (listed below) placed individually by the three of us, and a final, collective, unknown type cache (the one you are looking at now).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have visited the other caches in the series you should now have nine of the ten numbers needed to complete the final coordinates, represented by N 43 AB.CDE W 077 FG.HIJ. To obtain the tenth and final digit, plug the numbers you already have into the following equation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C = D/G+E-F*H+(A+I)/J-B&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be gentle with the cache container and please remember to use stealth if you are in a high muggle zone or near a hole that is currently being played!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy caching!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;Other caches in the (Mini) Golf Series:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://coord.info/GC4BF29"&gt;Is That Really My Score?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I used a little deduction to fill in a couple missing numbers and after two mulligans I landed it in the fairway.

Today I was able to make it to the final.  It was a cute ending to the series.  Thanks for the fun mini series.  All three of the CO's did a really nice job and I will tack on a favorite point to this nice wrap-up.

I couldn't join him today, but we did spend quite a bit of time on the phone.  The first set of coords didn't pan out, even though Tilley went there and checked it out, but we knew we were close.  One more little tweak and the satellite view looked very good.  A half hour later I couldn't stand it anymore and called him again to hear that he'd got the FTF.  Whoo Hoo!  

Fast forward to after dinner, well, I just had to go today.  No points, no glory, but I wanted to sign the log on the same day.  Great little series, fun puzzles, and a very well placed final.  TFTCs</groundspeak:text>

show that 13 people, mostly members of the French family, were
buried here during the 19th century. Interestingly, three of the
thirteen were named Betsey French.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please be respectful of the location. It looks like some kids may
hang around here sometimes, as we've removed some bottles and other
trash. If you see any other garbage, consider it a CITO opportunity
for you. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And daylight hours only, please!&lt;br /&gt;

I would like to thank all the cache owners who kept these caches maintained for this trip full of smiles. especially bridgebum for keeping this cache available for everyone to experience.

It seems as if nobody visits this lonely site, so that may change now that a cache has been placed here. We tried to find some history about the place, but came up empty. Please post info if you know anything about the place. Good luck!

dah) ... in Victor.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Dryer Road Park is a newly developed park. It has a grass
lacrosse field, a multi-purpose playing field, and a box lacrosse
area. There is also a playground. The park has a trail that links
up with Ganandagon's Granary Trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trail head is at the very back of the park's open grassy
playing fields. The trail is well marked with blue blazes. There
are several switch-backs, but &lt;b&gt;there is no need to bushwhack
straight up the hill.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache's name is a play on words with the dance troupe known
as Stomp -- so do a little dance when you find it! The cache
started out life stocked with various rubber stamps and related
items. Feel free to trade whatever sort of items you like. I'll
reload a few theme items whenever I do maintenance on the cache.
Signature items and travel bugs are always welcome, of course!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache container is a .30 caliber ammunition box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PKHWQ3 - Parking&lt;br /&gt;N 42° 58.301 W 077° 26.407&lt;br /&gt;Parking.&lt;br /&gt;THHWQ3 - Trailhead&lt;br /&gt;N 42° 58.261 W 077° 26.444&lt;br /&gt;Trailhead.&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Pvt. Henry S. Wells was born in 1842.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He was awarded, posthumously, the Medal of Honor, for his actions during the Civil War.  This was for heroism on Sept. 29, 1864 while serving with Company C, 148th New York Infantry, in action at Chapin's Farm, VA.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Along with two comrades, Pvt. Wells took position in advance of the skirmish line, within a short distance of the enemy's gunners and drove them from their guns. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He died Oct. 27, 1864 in Fair Oaks, VA while a POW.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His burial place is unknown, but this is the site of the family plot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is room to pull off and park.  Please be respectful of the area.&lt;br /&gt;

I was driving down the Thruway with the Tilley Hat one fine day, and this puzzle showed showed up.  He said I should take a look at it and I should be able to solve it, he was right.  I have been to the area once before, so I knew where to park.  The Pink Dairy Fairy and I had a very nice walk and we made a quick find.  Still in good shape, TFTC</groundspeak:text>

CO included the note for very good reason:  "You will be on marked trails until the last 50-75 feet" - unless of course, you do some unnecessary bushwacking!  (A straight line is NOT always the easiest way!)  We then once again found a lovely trail to follow back out.  Enjoyed both the puzzle and the cache.  It was a nice area to hike on a very hot day.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I've looked at this cache many times over the years. I knew what I had to do, but lacked the tools. Finally, I got the tools a couple weeks ago &amp; figured things out. Had some time this afternoon and took the walk to GZ. It was pretty muddy thanks to the weather the past couple days but I was there in no time. Circled the area a couple times and as I pulled out my phone to check for extra information, the cache finally appeared to me. Very well hidden! Glad to get this one finished off. Picked up a geocoin. TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Boy, what a day! No chance to get out before work to find a cache and the morning quickly filled up at work. What seemed like moments later, the work day was done and it was time to head home to grab a bite to eat and then schlep M3 down to Eastview to get his phone repaired. Five stores and 2.5 hours later, we were finally leaving and still no cache for the day had been found. Hmm.......

Thanks to the CO for leaving a few caches not too far from our location. The nearest ones sounded like too much for the group's energy level so we headed here for what sounded more up their alley. Bounced around a bit before finally settling here. Pointed out to M3 what he'd missed and we were soon signing in for our 17th August caching day and also filling in for our International Geocaching Day.

Thanks for the cache and the peaceful area to visit.</groundspeak:text>

The rains held off until 11 pm on my way home, and we had a gorgeous day. Saw lots of deer, including one very close to the parking roe The Spot. After getting our target cache, and taking some photos with some TB's, we needed a place to drop them off so came for this one just as it was getting twilighty and before we headed for home.

We arrived at the parking area, and looked at the notice board.  It was interesting to see that the last hunter that signed in a little over a week ago never signed back out!  Despite knowing that there might still be a hunter out there that may see our movements and possibly shoot us dead [:P], we continued on the path to the cache!
We then noticed the information mailbox along the trail that asked us to record our reflections.  DNStephens took the time to write a little something on behalf of all of us, then on we went.
JOEYF and myself had a couple of trackables that we wanted to place somewhere while we were out of the country, and this cache seemed to fit the bill!  Always nice to see a cub pack getting interested and informed about geocaching!

We had a nice walk to the cache, there was a pretty good trail most of the way and made an easy find.  Yes, I was glad to see a "regular" size containter too.  I would say that with the half mile hike this is not a terrain 1.5, more like a 2.5 and parking coords would be really helpful for us out of towners.

development that you'll see when you get to the top of the hill,

container, which is stocked with various trade items, log book and
our first Geocoin. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Parking for this cache can be found at a little pull off on the
east side of Victor/Egypt Road (CR 9), coordinates for parking
are:&lt;br&gt;
N 43 00.035&lt;br&gt;
W 077 23.894&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In the spring, summer, and fall there is a mowed trail that you can
follow to get pretty close to the cache. Some bush whacking is
required to get to the cache. I wouldn't recommend searching for
this cache in the winter, as there really isn't any place to park
due to snow on the side of the road.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Last cache that we attempted today--and after finding 6 with HopNSeek--they went home--we tried this one cache. Enjoyed the view on this lovely day--enjoyed the mowed path--didn't really enjoy the tall grass--and, of course, was frustrated not to find an ammo can. It has been a while since this one was found so I can suggest that you check this one--we have missed ammo cans in the past--after all the honeysuckle bushes were, well, bushy and the grass was as high as an elephant eye--but it has been a while. Thanks.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Used the nearby sister cache to fill the double need for an August cache as well as filling our yearly International Geocaching Day challenge. Relocated the geo-van and M3 tried to scoop me on the find. Wasn't sure how close we'd be getting to the neighbor but were quickly relieved to find it wouldn't be too close.

Had fun egging on M3 as my approach gave me a better view of the hide. The pressure delayed his find for 30 seconds but he soon got to where he needed to be to spot the cache. Signed in and soon were on our way to a reward dinner and treat before heading back home.

We got an early start leaving at 6:30 a.m. and returning at 6:30 p.m. The weather was great, the mosquitoes not so bad, the scenery was beautiful and the caching successful. Thanks for the hide.

Lots and lots of back roads that I am sure I have never been on.  Was successful at this cache and thankful for it.  My thanks for you placing it.

It must be gone. We live too far away to return any time soon. CO if it is gone we would appreciate the smilie. Let us know. Thanks. Her log says it all. Keep up the good work.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I must grumpily say that we spent WAAAAY too much time looking for this difficulty 1 cache.  I'm estimating . . . 45 minutes?  Oh yeah.  Easily.

As I'm walking back to the geomobile I'm thinking one of the following scenarios must apply here:

1) We are either totally off our game and/or blind.  
2) This isn't really a 1 star difficulty
3) The coords are really off
4) This cache is completely missing/not currently in position

Once I got back to the car and looked at the pictures - WOW!!  There is no way a cache THAT BIG could possible be present on our side of the fence, even the coords were 100 feet off.  Speaking of which, I would personally call that a LARGE, which is sort of cool to log, because they are hard to come by.  I would also advise updating the coords, as several logs speak of the 40 foot deviation. 

Regardless... You'll have this from time to time.  Thanks, anyway, for placing the cache for all to enjoy.</groundspeak:text>

Since that OUTDOOR LIFE article, New York state and the National Wild Turkey Federation have joined forces to make this a major turkey nesting area. As such, DO NOT VENTURE HERE DURING HUNTING SEASON! At other times you might encounter a hiker or mountain biker, but not much chance of a muggler.

This cache is/was the launch point for TB "Terrain Navigator". The Navigator was delighted to get his wheels wet, his frame muddied and his sides scratched by the abundant thorn bushes. The thorns are so thick that I suggest that you stick the the trail both in and out. 

Terrain Navigator has a bunch of Groupies (Hot Wheels) that inhabit this cache. If you find them, please take a Groupie, but please also leave one if you can

Looked promising, but found major stream flooding here as well.  

Managed to get myself across with a few precarious hops, and trudged up for a find (cyost found it in spirit, had slipped on muddy bank trying to hop across the stream).  Didn't have anything to leave, but next time we're up in the Fingerlakes we'll bring something nice for the next to find.  :)</groundspeak:text>

Probably not suitable for wheelchairs, but fine for a quick trip with the kids.Be sure to visit the real attraction here, The Wizard of Clay. You'll be astonished at the variety and uniqueness of his craft. Budget an hour for the cache and browsing and enjoy your visit. The cache is a 30 caliber ammo box with trinkets and a log.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We originally planned on 23 Battleships today, but we ended up running out of steam and daylight, so we were forced to bypass 7 of them, and 2 were possibly missing - so that leaves 14 completed ships today!  This was our first Battleship of the day, but represents the 12th of 40 found caches our daily best, surpassing last year's Father/Daughter geo-day of 38 (in the greater Mendon Ponds area).

Back to the cache - We were decidedly going EASTBOUND, not WESTBOUND, so disguising ourselves as "employees" we marched across the lot as if we owned the place, though inside I was quite nervous about the whole thing.  All was well and we now have another Battleship smiley.  

A big THANKS goes out to the cache owner.  I have a hard enough time keeping up with my own caches, which are specifically in close proximity to me.  I cannot imagine keeping a series as spread out at these going - which you've successfully done for more than a year.  Good job!!  And again - thank you for fun times!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">LOVED all parts of this cache, although if I remember correctly, I needed a little help with the first part.  But I enjoyed doing it.  G2 and I went out on this beautiful morning and at WP1, forgetting there was a WP2, I told her we were looking for a large container.  Initially totally overlooked what we were supposed to be seeing, but then had the aha moment!  Didn't realize we couldn't get there from here, although tried for a little bit.  Finally drove to a better location to make the find.  Really appreciate your creativity.  The lack thereof is keeping me from placing caches - I want them to be this good!</groundspeak:text>

Today we were running late before dinner and decided to do just one more - this one.  I didn't realize it was a two-parter, and was giving N2 the coordinates when we got to the search area, when I overheard the kids babbling about something.  Wait - what?  We found the waypoint that way - just perfect!  We made our way to the final and found that also with no problems.  This cache is now one of my all-time favorites for the fun puzzle and overal awesomeness of the WP.  Thanks for the great cache!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We loved this cache!  We found it as a result of a search for a cache that was placed on our anniversary - 7/11/2011 - so that we can eventually get GC2WTC9, a Challenge cache.  Well it happens I'm a big Killer Sudoku fan so solving this puzzle was reasonably easy.  Getting out here was another thing as we live near Albany and it's about a 4 hour drive.  Coincidentally, Fantine's mom lives about two miles away - on Mertensia Road in Victor.  We visited today, went out and found this fabulous multi - and then went on to find "YOU - A Challenge Cache" (GC2WTC9).  As an aside, my 17-year-old cat Annie is on her last legs.  You KNOW what I will eventually do as a tribute to her.  This gets a fav point for sure.

We dropped a TB that we picked up in the Albany area.  Just a tag, no little item attached to it, but that's how we found it.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I had tackled this puzzle several times when it first came out with no luck. Yesterday I tried it again, and after two more tries, had the puzzle solved. Then what? The pattern I thought I saw didn't pan out after several pleas to Evince, so I started wondering if I had the puzzle solved correctly after all. I emailed a pic of it to Bridgebum who promptly called me back to assure me I had solved the puzzle correctly and gave me a lesson on how to read it. 

They were re-paving the entrance to WP1 yesterday so I came back this morning. I quickly found out the reason for all the accolades about WP1. That alone was worth a favorite point.  I assumed I would have to phone a friend again when the light bulb went off. What a great idea! 

The walk to the final was very pleasant. I had been to the nearby trail before but not back here. Thanks for the fun!</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is located on a trail intalled in 2004 by the Town of
Victor, NY.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The trail is located in a new (2004) housing development on
Gillis Road. The housing development is called The Hamptons, and
the trailhead is on Yale Court at the following coordinates N 43
00.483 / W 077 25.121. You'll find a small gravel parking area
there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a pond, wetlands/marshy areas, trees, hills, etc. There
was a heron along the edge of the pond when I was there. The trail
is uneven in a number of places and can be muddy when it's been wet
out, so it's probably not the easiest walk for small children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache's name comes from the fact that it started out life
stocked with various art supplies. Feel free to trade whatever sort
of items you like. I'll reload a few theme items whenever I do
maintenance on the cache. Signature items and travel bugs are
always welcome, of course!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache container is a .30 caliber ammunition box.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Lid was on the ground nearby, so I put it all back together and put it back where I found it.  The log was just a scrap of paper.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Out today collecting 100 points worth of lonely caches.  After stopping at an "extra" cache before this one I got onto a different trail then I thought I was on.  Kept thinking it would bring me back but that was not the case.  Instead of backtracking kept going and took the really long way here, but made it!  

Enjoyed the puzzle but initially tried to do it without the suggestion in the hint...bad idea.  Came up with the answer and today was the day to go grab it.  This was out in the open so tucked it back in after signing the log.  Thanks for the puzzle and TFTC!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Fifth cache find of the day (second one of your puzzle caches).  Funny thing was that I came across a similarly patterned puzzle cache shortly after I had figured yours out.  That one is much closer to my homebase in Scottsville (still have yet to run up and get it though).  Anyways, I was relieved to find the entrance to the orange trail off of Rte 251 so I could take a nice stroll in the shady woods instead of out in the blazing sun on the Auburn trail to get to the cache.  Nice trail in here -- liked the boardwalk and the bridges across the creek bed.  Found the cache quickly and in good condition.  Decided to leave a Travel bug here for the next cacher.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">3rd puzzle of the day found with cheryyll on a puzzle run up this way.  It was a beautiful day to walk, and I truly enjoyed this clever puzzle, so even though the length of the walk was a bit beyond my normal comfort zone, I wanted to give it a shot.  I was assuming a straight grassy or paved trail like some of the other ones around here.  Let's just say that I was in for a bit of a surprise!  I managed to avoid getting muddy, but I did get pretty squishy, wet feet on the way in (managed to improvise a bit and stay dry on the way out).  We wandered in circles a bit when we arrived, as there were many spots to check.  I was very happy when cheryyll spotted the little guy.  Thanks for the puzzle and the cache! [:)]</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">My journey continued in the park with this cache.  This was a quick one after the previous two caches. We were lucky, the bugs weren't too bad n here today.  Had a great walk and a great time.

I am only  a few away form having all the CO's caches. I still can't believe all the work that has gone into these.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We were caching along these trails tonight and this was our third find.  Wow, the trails have become very muddy with an actual stream running through one area that was not here during my last visit.  We crossed the water and made our way to the GZ.  Eagle eye Mr. P spotted it first.  Very happy to find it as we were caching in the rain and darkness was fast approaching.  We dropped off a TB that just squeezed inside.  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Great cache!  I got to the spot and the spotted the prize.  Eyed up the surroundings and decided it was the perfect setup to do one of my patented gymnastics moves that fly me directly to the cache and leave my friends shaking their heads.  So with one quick move I was at the cache.  Great fun, and anytime I get to pull that move out I give it a favorite point!  

Thanks for the fun cache!

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">This is a Finger Lakes ACA cache; check the bookmark for others.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The winter of 2012 - 2013 was long and gray. We (Teamajk, DeltaDelta1 and Yurtles ) coped with the early winter of 2013 by turning our backs on it. Solving puzzle caches was a good way to keep warm and dry and entertained. Cache puzzles posed by sujojeepers and mcdurr in California and Bumble! in Massachusetts were particularly challenging and educational. Each puzzle we solved was based on a different cipher from this American Cryptogram Association list. Click &lt;a target="_ blank" href="http://www.cryptogram.org/cipher_types.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Now we want to share the fun with you by placing some ACA cipher caches in the Finger Lakes area. Good luck and have fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is not at the posted coordinates. You must solve the puzzle to get the cache. There are three one dollar gold coins, one each for the first three finders. Please bring your own pencil or pen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fiddle is basically the same as a violin with the main differences being how the instrument is played and how it is set up. Fiddle music generally refers to bluegrass, country and other folk styles of music. The fiddle in bluegrass music is predominately a lead or melodic instrument along with a six string guitar.&lt;br /&gt;
Bluegrass music can be found at the many Finger Lakes Region’s fiddlers' festivals like the Old Time Fiddlers' Gathering or Pickin' In The Pasture. Often you will see the youngest fiddler form a duet with the oldest to play a favorite song or two. Of all the stringed instruments played in bluegrass music, the fiddle is usually the heart of the song.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Woohoo!  I was pretty excited to get this right with many thanks to the CO for all the nudges!  I had wanted to solve some of these puzzles as they were about the only caches I still had to do close to home.   I had a lot of fun learning about the cipher and then working it out.  Went for the cache on this beautiful sunny day.  Thanks for the fun puzzle, the help and the hide.</groundspeak:text>

So after or bug story at the previous cache I thought we were safe...

We stop here and I think 'no problem'.  Well I forgot to right the clue from certitude down so I was looking everywhere.  Oh there it is!!! Nope, that is broken glass wedged in a spot I shouldn't have been looking. A bit of blood loss and a few minutes and I spotted the cache. 

Note to future finders - pay attention to the clue so you don't try to grab at the wrong thing....doh!

This was another mind straining Delta old school puzzle that took a lot of time. The one good thing is now I was caught up and had all his caches once again.

Then I got home and saw yet another new one....

Thanks for a great puzzle and a nice place to visit. I made the hike in while my wife waited in the car. Good thing I can move fast when I need to. I made the round trip back before she got to bored.

We may not be first to solve or first to find, however we (mostly jfw) eventually work our way to solving the puzzle, finding the cache and signing the log. This was our fifth stop on an epic DeltaDelta sign the log day. Thanks for the brain exercise!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was my first stop of the day on my way caching up to Rochester, hoping to be able to mark my 999th cache at tomorrow's GeoRoc picnic.  After a pleasant drive up from Ithaca, including a productive stop at the Waterlook Outlets, I stopped and made the quick find here.  The caretaker was mowing the grass, but I did my best to get in and out quickly without drawing undue attention.  I had enjoyed the puzzle when it came out, and am happy to now be able to make the find.  Who knows if I will ever get out west to do the series that inspired this one, but it's been great to have this new series much closer at hand!  [:D]  Signed in and off to the next one.  Thanks for the puzzle and the cache! [:)]</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Rats!  This turned out to be a textbook example of knowing what to do but not seeing it through to the end.  Hate when I do that!

I was working late when this was published (seems like that's all I've been doing), but I did get a chance to try a few things before heading to bed.  Momd and I were emailing some thoughts back and forth, and we were both on the exact same wavelength.  Unfortunately, that meant we were also both stuck at the same spot.  With no other thoughts to try I decided to turn in and sleep on it.

I was very happy to get an email the next day from momd saying that she had figured it out.  (Nice job, momd!)  A quick word or two in her note helped me refocus on something we had discussed the night before, but I had to wait until I got home to look into it further.  I jumped on it as soon as I could, and not long after I had final coords in hand.

With my brother visiting my dad and sisters in Geneva I knew I'd be heading right by GZ this weekend.  I was running a bit late, but passing by without signing in was completely out of the question.  I hopped out of the car with hopes of making a quick find, but, being the muggle magnet that I am, I had a few people I needed to wait out first.  The second the coast was clear I signed in, grabbed the 2nd to find coin (thank you for that!), left a PathTag and hightailed it out of there.

This was another fun puzzle to solve, and I enjoyed the location of the hide.  Thanks for putting it all together!</groundspeak:text>

P.S., We thought the puzzle was slightly evil but we have to admit the clues are there.  Funny how the clues are always so much easier to read after the puzzle has been solved.</groundspeak:text>

This logbook may need updating soon...not so much that it is full, but rather that the first clue is a little smushed and a bit hard to decipher.  We put down what we thought it was and by process of elimination we were correct!

THIS IS A 4.5 and a 4.5 and I mean it!</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Your are under no obligation to do this cache!  I take no responsibility for any one doing this without proper equipment or anyone getting hurt here.  You assume full responsibility if you undertake this cache.
 Do not bring kids here unless fully supervised.  It is a 100' fall if you slip. Use common sense here.  
 Equipment needed:  100' rope, ascender, harness, hard hat if you wish.. If you can not pull your own weight up a STEEP incline, you will need waders or high boots to walk the stream back to a place to get to land.  


 Boots.. and I have been cache buddies for years.  Since I started almost.  He is very athletic and into ropes and climbing.  So only fitting this cache be placed for him. 

  Special Thanks to TheDonnerparty for helping with the placement and helpful ideas on the hide!

 Cords take you to a place where you will need to retieve an item needed to open cache.  PLEASE RETURN WHEN DONE, or next person is out of luck.  
Next cords will take to a tree that is very sturdy.  You can afix your rope here and start your trip to the cache.  Once there you can pull back up, or lower into the creek below.  This can be interesting if water is high or in winter.  ( See disclaimer at top!!) Cache is an ammo that when opened can dump it's contents so please use care when opening and closing.

Because of the level on this cache, I ask that only cachers who actually travel to the cache container sign the log.  Groups where one person signs for others on top will not be allowed. You have to earn this one!

Trails are dawn to dusk.  Careful during hunting season.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Alright two weeks ago we made a snap decision to stop here and see what we were in for. Saved all the way points, and have realized that we have become far too complacent in our wandering. Neither of us has any reactions to poison ivy or other poisonous plants. So going into the woods with shorts no problem, until now... I have found this crazy plant called stinging nettles,,, impressive. so no more toe shoes or shorts while caching [:)] 
  On a happier note we did get this cache after going to the bottom, then back up, then back down and a final climb out. Kind of scary without rope.  Also much harder to do after a rain, wet muddy and sweaty but smiling from ear to ear. Wanted to get this one for awhile.  Thanks so much!! lots of fun!!</groundspeak:text>

Should be easy enough, I averaged Location 400 counts or so. The cache itself is a small waterproof container about the size of a film canister with only a log inside, no room for a pencil so make sure you bring your own! This cache is also very snow friendly! Take a few minutes and enjoy the area. You may also want to take a walk on the Ontario pathways just across the steet!

We finished the park and came back and the CO was laughing - the cache was still there. I got myself to GZ and kicked myself. I was so focused on what had been I didn't see what is. 

Great job on this one! It was also good to be able to chat with him and thank him for all is hard work.  This has been the summer of the Tilleyhat

Although we got there easily enough, it took us a few minutes to find it.  I found it and retrieved trackable TCH8HE.  I went to put the container back and dropped it!  OMG!  With Lakeladys much needed help we got it back it its right place.  The bridge is beautiful in its own right and the scenery from it is awesome.  We disturbed a couple of snakes while walking the trail.  They didn't bother me, but Lakelady didn't like them too much.  TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

Victor. A section of the
&lt;a href="http://www.victorhikingtrails.org/map/index.php"&gt;Victor
Hiking Trails&lt;/a&gt; runs through the park. 
&lt;p&gt;The cache is also a one-part hide for our technology-averse
letterboxing friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is named for those oft-maligned travelers of the rail.
This park is near the convergence of what once was two railroads
and a trolley line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a 30 cal. ammo can containing some trade items. The
first to find prize is an unactivated travel bug.&lt;/p&gt;
Congratulations to TazD for the geocaching FTF and to ChileHead for
the letterboxing version!&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK1FX3F - Parking Lot&lt;br /&gt;N 42° 59.705 W 077° 26.214&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

As we approached, one of the women asked us (1st thing no less) if we were geocaching, which, of course, we were.  After some introductions, it was nice to be able to meet another local GC'r (thanks 5C's!) and put a face with the name!  Found WP 1 w/out too much trouble, retrieved our bikes, and made our way to the final.  Thanks for the hide, and thanks to 5C's for the company!</groundspeak:text>

Actually, I'm glad I didn't find it last time because since then I have gotten into letterboxing a little bit and I now have a hand carved signature stamp.  The stamp for  this cache is broken in 2 pieces but I was able to  align them well enough to get a really nice impression.  Thanks!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">07/24/2013 14:48 Found: Ta-da!  Got a note from the CO with the final coords, and then a note that the first stage was replaced.  I entered the final coordinates directly into the GPSr before I left the hotel.  Only to find out that I fat fingered something and was about 67 miles off.  That seemed a little much to me, so I tried stage 1 again.  Found it quickly this time.  Thanks for replacing it!  I enjoyed the walk to the final, and had it in hand within a few minuted of getting my head out of my butt and really looking.  There it was!  Aha!  Thanks for the letterbox hybrid.  There is not a TB in this cache, btw.</groundspeak:text>

First I walked by it and forgot to get the wp.  So I ended up having to do some extra walking.

The boys were pretty tuckered from a few largely sleepless nights, so they hung back while I took the walk from where I parked (closer to the corner) to the search area.

Had one idea in mind when I approached the search area. Thought my GPSr was leading me astray since it wanted to take me where I'd ruled out looking. Turns out it was right and I was wrong. [;)] Signed in and replaced as found.

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">We placed this cache in memory of our German Shepherd Aron. Aron spent hours walking this trail with many of our family members. He loved this trail and would often walk the first half checking everything out and then he would run the second half back.  I think he enjoyed exercising his family.  Aron only had 7 short years with us but he will remain with us always. For the First Find I have a K9 Service Coin. There is room for small trades and as always BYOP Congrats to cillballs for the FTF. I hope you enjoy the K9 coin. Also we encourage pics of any or all geo dogs.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This one was tough but I think it's just because I'm out of shape! Went with my boyfriend z.e., left some hello kitty stickers in the cache and took a little dinosaur for our cache stache. Really beautiful area but super, super uphill! I'm proud of this one, it's the hardest I've done so far!
Also, it was about 95 degrees today, that didn't help! Ha! TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

GPS is about dead on. hidden well and a nice hike in for us and the dogs.  we've hiked here for years and never knew the cache was there.  sun was setting on the way out, a perfect view and took some great photos.  we took nothing from the cache but left a pen, a pirate eraser and some beads.  we loved the noodle kidoodle!  good luck to all. thanks</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This is what caching is all about for me.  Never been here, probably never would have, but decided to check out the area due to your old cache and all the favorites.  Picked the wrong trail out, and the trail kept getting worse and worse till it degenerated into a deer trail, then bushwhack across a meadow.  Nice hide area and of course a nice excellent trail for the hike back.  Nice views too.  Great cache thanks.</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The cache has a “Space” theme and has been seeded with appropriate trade items. Please try to keep the theme going!

&lt;p&gt;The Observatory grounds are open to the public, but the gates are locked except during Open House, special events, and monthly meetings. If you don’t mind a short walk up the driveway, you can search for the cache any time dawn to dusk. Nighttime hunts are not allowed as to prevent flashlights from disturbing any sky observing and photography. Please be aware that hunters pass through the grounds during hunting season. Search at your own risk during October-December and May hunting seasons; wearing Blaze Orange is recommended.

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a two-part puzzle cache on a section of the &lt;a href="http://www.victorhikingtrails.org/map/index.php"&gt;Victor Hiking Trail&lt;/a&gt;. The above coordinates are for one possible parking place.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Alert: The following paragraph contains a link to a file containing details needed to find this geocache. As the cache owner, I represent that this file is safe to download although it has not been checked by Groundspeak or by the reviewer for possible malicious content. Download this file at your own risk.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Solve &lt;a href="http://www.jigidi.com/solve.php?id=5S4ZFM0T"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; to get the coordinates for a plastic box hidden in the woods. However, when you find it, you &lt;u&gt;won't&lt;/u&gt; have found the cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CONFUSED? Don't be! In that box is another puzzle to be solved. Once that is achieved, you can search for the final. You'll need to head a bit off the path for WP1, but the final is within a couple feet of the trail.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is small wooden puzzle for the FTF prize.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Congratulations to Cyndi53 for being the first to find!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I had this solved a while ago and came out today for a find.  I had forgotten that there was a second part.  Luckily, I was able to solve quickly and move on.  On my way to WP2, I startled a rabbit who ran straight down the trail ahead of me so I was able to watch him run on the fresh snow for quite a while.  Made a quick find at 2 and took a less scenic shortcut back to my chosen parking area.  Thanks for a fun one.</groundspeak:text>

Was intrigued by their description of paper puzzles. Went looking for them on-line one night, found this one and stayed up past bedtime to,finish it! 

Taking a break from another cache in area, finally went after WP1, where I made several words without using all the letters, then thought I had a solution. But no, I was wrong. Then I started laughing as I rearranged the blocks again, full belly laugh! Oh, you two are funny! Mixed up blocks and hid box well again.Headed out, spent a little time searching in snow, then uncovered cache! For that lovely chuckle, dropped off TB Donut Go	Gentle Into That Good Night. Replaced plastic bag for log as it would not seal.

Looked for Criss Cross before leaving Victor, but muggles interrupted me. Next time!</groundspeak:text>

Adopted on 1-11-11 to enhance the CS-150 series in the village of Clifton Springs.  Brandon, Thank you for all your efforts in placing the hide, and later arranging its adoption.  New container and new coords 05.30.2012  esf23</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">In the words of the original owner: "This is my second Hide and probably my last one in the state of NY, as I will be moving in a few months. The cache is a waterproof outdoor container of decent size, it has a logbook and pen, and is packed full of trinkets to trade. Something for everyone is this one, small toys, playing cards etc. The cache is fairly well hidden but make sure to place the cache as found to ensure a good time for the next person.

Park is closed from dusk till dawn.

Parking is available at N42 57.889   W077 07.952

Snow pack will make this one difficult, but it may still be possible in light snow.


Congrats to Boots... on his 900th cache and FTF!!!"


* * * A word on adoption: It's easy, earth-friendly and a good way to keep worth-while caches active.  Use the app at http://www.geocaching.com/adopt/</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Passed through town a couple of months ago and was bummed to find some of the caches I'd never had time to stop for had been archived. Oh well. Strike while the opportunity is there.

Didn't realize there had been a few caches put out in the area until driving through on my way to Keuka Lake for a night. Wasn't able to stop on the way through due to time constraints but sure to stop while passing back through town.

Didn't know what to expect but liked the favorite points this had been awarded. Followed my GPSr from the other nearby cache to the search area for this and was soon hunting. Started at a bad angle for spotting the cache but the GPSr soon led me to the proper vantage. Nice job with the container and my GPSr really liked the coordinates.

Thanks for the cool cache! Hope you have fun designing your follow-up caches. Can't wait to pass through town again!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">#1019[8D]. Great Camo very creative favorite point added! we were on our way to our cabin in Edmeston after spending a few days in Geneva. 29 down 2 to go for August. we were grabbing a few caches along the way and picked this one randomly, I`m so glad we did. the wife aka Druzzil and I made our way to GZ and started our search, the coords were jumpy and kept bringing me away from where we found the cache. I was searching a few likely spots when the wife says is this it, sure enough it was. took about 10min to make the find we didn`t undestand the hint and didn`t bother looking it up. Thanks for the Fun Cache Hunt! SL and returned. I have a few caches that are well crafted on Long Island, I think I will try and make one like this one, Thanks for the great idea!</groundspeak:text>

We found another cache in the area and decide to try and find this one as well as we walked through the grave yard...  This was our 3d cache find. Did have to google to help with the clue.

   <groundspeak:short_description html="False">I use this trail quite a bit and have placed this cache for a few reasons. First reason is that it is close to my house and I bike ride this trail frequently, making it easy to maintain. Second, is to make full use of this beautiful trail. Third and most important is to get some folks out for some exercise. There are 2 available parking areas, giving 2 levels of effort. The cache is a small lock’n’lock. Please park in designated parking lots only.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Parking area 1 will give you a total walk of 2 miles and a chance to pick up one more cache. 

To do the whole enchilada, go to parking area number 2. This will give a total hike/ride of about 5.5 miles (not including search mileage, which may vary), some great scenery and the chance for about 7 caches, at least for those cachers who have not visited this trail yet. This trail makes for a great bike ride. The ride to the cache is a very slight uphill that you probably won’t notice until you head back to the parking area. Makes for a nice ride back. To finish off the trip in the summertime, there is an ice cream stand down the road about .25 miles east.

Just for the fun of it, please note in your log which parking area you used and how many caches you find.

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">This cache is located in Lehigh Crossing Park in the town of Victor
on Victor-Mendon Road (Rte 251). The entrance to the park is
&lt;b&gt;directly&lt;/b&gt; across the road from the Auburn Creek Golf
entrance.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The 54 acre Lehigh Crossing Park was dedicated in 2001. It has
wetland areas in the front of the park along with a couple of small
ponds. I observed some ducks there when I placed the cache. The
trail is at the back part of the park along with an open field. You
can also hook up with the Lehigh Valley Trail in the northwest
corner of the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notice:&lt;/b&gt; The park's entrance looks sort of like a
construction entrance, but there's now (as of mid-2004) a sign
indicating it's a park. There are two tall, rusty posts and a metal
gate. The entance is paved, but has seen better days and it turns
into a dirt road after a short bit. There is also construction
debris here and there along the road into the park. &lt;b&gt;Park your
car by the ponds and walk in from there. If you try to drive in any
farther your vehicle might get stuck!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache's name does not reflect any sort of difficulty nor
danger level. It comes from the fact that it started out life
stocked with dice, dice games, and other dice-oriented items. Let
me know how your luck was in finding the cache! Feel free to trade
whatever sort of items you like. I'll reload a few theme items
whenever I do maintenance on the cache. Signature items and travel
bugs are always welcome, of course!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache container is a .30 caliber ammunition box.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

We had all the numbers right...YAY...but it really comes down to when you actually enter them into the GPS!  It turns out that SOONER would have been better than LATER! Oh well, as my hero..Winnie ther Pooh would say "I am a bear of very little brain".  A lesson learned??? that we may or may not long remember :O
Thank you for the wonderful, totally doable series and a reason to hike this pathway today.

AND, strangely enough, despite the temps today, I had a nice cool breeze--enough to keep the mosquitoes away.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">A busy morning of work followed by 2.5 hours of school shopping had left everyone a bit punchy. A reward dinner and dessert calmed the nerves and freed up a few minutes for me to make the stop needed to visit this area while on the way home. While everyone finished up their ice cream, I took a quick walk down the trail to visit the nearby caches.

Started at this spot and the accurate coordinates made for a short visit. Dove in at the best spot and soon was in the correct search area. Overshot my GPSr by a bit to check out a spot I liked and was quickly rewarded with the flash of the cache. Signed in before the bugs could zero in on me and soon was on my way back to the van.

You may need to move your cache away from the sign to keep your oldest cache alive.  Also, you may need to change the to 2/2 which is required walk and not park and grab or HC.

Got within 60' of GZ to see "POSTED" signs on many trees on that side of the path--including the area around GZ. Well, heck, no one was around to see, right? Anyway, With coords bouncing like mad, and many possible places to search, and a 10 minute time limit, and the slight illegality of it all, I didn't manage to find this one.

&lt;br /&gt;
När vi fick reda på att han skulle komma på besök och hade nyligen tagit upp geocaching - vi visste att vi behövde för att sätta en cache i hans ära. Vi ville tacka honom för alltid är så kul att prata med och för att bli en bra kompis.&lt;br /&gt;

Working at our company we have met many wonderful people.  There is one of our distributors that always makes our day when he calls.  He is always so friendly and takes the time to better your day everytime you talk to him. &lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Geocaching always takes me places I've never been, and this neat trail was definitely one of them.  I went exploring Yippee!!!  Took yellow peace sign beads--hoping I can leave them in one of the Peace Sign series in Seattle (view geocaching map, look up Kirkland Washington, then move to the south and west a little bit to see a giant peace sign in Puget Sound), and left a 9-in-1 pocket tool.  Thanks for the adventure!  It really IS a magical world.

Geocaching alltid tar mig lägger jag aldrig varit, och denna prydliga trail var definitivt en av dem. Jag gick utforska Yippee! Tog gula pärlor fredstecken - hoppas jag kan lämna dem i en av fredstecken serien i Seattle (view geocaching kartan, leta upp Kirkland Washington, sedan flytta till söder och väster lite för att se en gigantisk fredstecken i Puget Sound ), och lämnade ett nio-i-ett fickverktyget. Tack för äventyret! Det är verkligen en magisk värld.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">A busy morning of work followed by 2.5 hours of school shopping had left everyone a bit punchy. A reward dinner and dessert calmed the nerves and freed up a few minutes for me to make the stop needed to visit this area while on the way home. While everyone finished up their ice cream, I took a quick walk down the trail to visit the nearby caches.

Started down the trial and then worked my way back to this cache. Seemed like an appropriate way to end International Geocaching Day, finishing up with a cache having some international flavor to it!

Had passed the hiding area and had an idea of where to focus my search. Wasn't sure if I should zig or zag. The zig worked fine. Other than clearing out a dense spiderweb with my forehead, the cache went smoothly and I was soon signing in on the log.

Thanks for the fun and introduction to this section of the Victor Hiking Trail.</groundspeak:text>

Then I decided to use my geosense, and headed about 40 feet away to a likely host.  I spent a solid 5 minutes crawling all over that sucker until I found the cache.  Thanks for the hide.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">First, congrats to Mr T. Hat for reaching the 2000 mark (and beyond).

I didn't take the shortest way to gz, but I did enjoy an easy, longer walk.  Once at gz, the cache was quickly found.

Thanks for bringing me back to the great location!  Left a tb.</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Nice trails around and through a meadow. In the summer come and see the butterflies that live here. In the winter you might consider bringing along snowshoes or cross country skis. In the spring..boots are needed.
 For a somewhat flat hike, park on Wilkinson Rd. You can also park at the end of Bunker Hill Dr. for a hilly hike (that would make this a much higher terrain rating). 
 Cache is a small container that will only hold a small TB or coin. FTF gets a not-so-shiney one dollar bill.

Lots of snow on the ground when this was placed. FTF will have a good workout!  Think spring!!

Congrats to StrivingforCamelot and TheTilleyHat for their co-FTF. They certainly earned it!!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I am working on a challenge to find a multi cache for 15 consecutive days.  I hadn't planned on being away when I started it so I was left scrambling to find a cache along our route that I'd be able to find today.  Unfortunately I only found a zip tie where I think the redirect was located.  Gorham looks like a nice little town though, maybe another trip to NY I'll have better luck here.  On to the next closest multi!</groundspeak:text>

The markers are mostly readable, so you can learn about the Doyle family members buried there.

The cache is a 2 qt cammo plastic bottle. It is NOT located near any grave marker, so please treat the area with respect and do NOT search near them.

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This morning I was out walking with ChileHead.  As usual, I was dragging him behind me.  I really don't know why I bring him as he just slows me down.

My keen canine senses picked up the scent of something that didn't belong.   As I approached an area full of downed trees, I stuck my nose into the snow and found something unnatural.  

Chilehead says to me "Isn't this the archived cache of Peppermill 6-pack?"  

I said "Don't ask me.  I'm a dog.  Can I pee on it?"

So we dragged it a short distance away, freshened up the logbook, and rechristened it as a lost cache.  I was upset that Peppermill would leave her geotrash out in the woods.  I mean, the thing has been archived a whole day already.  That's like forever in dog days.

This is probably only the second series that I have ever finished on the day I started it.

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache is &lt;b&gt;NOT&lt;/b&gt; located as the listed coordinates. But it is a very good place to park.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.drivehq.com/file/df.aspx/publish/bridgebum/PublicFolder/flexagons/title301.jpg" border="0" height="250" width="500" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is hidden on a moderately hilly section of the &lt;a href="http://www.victorhikingtrails.org/map/index.php"&gt;Victor Hiking Trails&lt;/a&gt;. There is some poison ivy along the trail, but none in the vicinity of the hide.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As explained in &lt;a href="http://coord.info/GC3PN53"&gt;Flexagons 101&lt;/a&gt;, flexagons are folded pieces of paper that can be flexed to reveal faces other than the original front and back. Before being able to search for this cache, you'll need to build (and flex) a heptahexaflexagon, a somewhat complex construction that is 6-sided with seven(!) different faces.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Alert: The following paragraph contains links to files containing details needed to find this geocache. As the cache owner, I represent that these files are safe to download although they have not been checked by Groundspeak or by the reviewer for possible malicious content. Download these files at your own risk.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You'll need scissors and a glue stick. First print &lt;a href="http://www.drivehq.com/file/df.aspx/publish/bridgebum/PublicFolder/flexagons/flexagon301.pdf"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; out. It's a two page document. If your printer can print two sided, you should be able print both sides on the same piece of paper with pretty good alignment. You may have to experiment. Otherwise, print out two separate pages. Then follow &lt;a href="http://www.drivehq.com/file/df.aspx/publish/bridgebum/PublicFolder/flexagons/creating301.pdf"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; directions to build your flexagon.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you look at your completed flexagon, you'll notice that one side shows the "University of Geocaching" logo, while the other has orange and gray triangles showing various numbers. If you read clockwise around the perimeter, your'll see "43 0 1 3 2 5". That's one &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;possible&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; latitude for this cache. As you play with the flexagon, you will discover 5 different latitudes and 5 different longitudes showing up on the perimeter. The correct pair will be where the total of all the digits adds up to 58. So for the latitude shown, 4+3+0+1+3+2+5=18. &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;If&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; you found a longitude that added to 40, then the total for the two would be 58.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Click on the 'Related Web Page' link above to see how to flex your flexagon.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You'll want to &lt;a href="http://geocheck.org/geo_inputchkcoord.php?gid=612012926d3dcaa-1d07-4d1c-b8bf-741aa6ee8118"&gt;check your solution&lt;/a&gt;, since there's additional information there about the cache!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is a lock-n-lock containing a few trade items. Congratulations to &lt;b&gt;Mom-n-Andy&lt;/b&gt; for again being first to find!

Nan-Sea took a shot at this one right after it came out, but we couldn't come up with all the numbers.  After quite some time, I recreated the flexagon, and with the benefits of the added hint, I was able to come up with the final coords.  Today, Nan-Sea and I decided it was a great day to head out and find the final.  We found the final quickly, but had a little issue trying to retrieve it.  It was frozen in it's location.  We were able to chip it free, and sign it.
Thanks for another fun puzzle.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I always enjoy Bridgebum caches and this one was no exception. The fact that only 15 people have found this over 5 months is testimony that this one was a real toughie. I wore out two sets of flexagons before finally getting the coords. That last one was a real bear. 

It was a pleasant 1.5 mile round trip hike to sign in at this one this morning. The cache remains in pristine condition. I have now found all of Bridgebum's caches. I cant wait to see what else he has up his sleeve.

Thanks for the fun.</groundspeak:text>

celebrating Cinco de Mayo.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font face=
"Comic Sans MS" size="4"&gt;&lt;font color="#BB0626"&gt;Feel free to grab a
duck to take home to celebrate this special time with you and your
family.If you don't wish to adopt a duck,or there are no ducks left
please make sure to make a note of the symbol written on the bottom
of the ducks or in the log. There may also be "coupons" in the
cache to obtain a duck from me at geocaching events.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You will need to know the symbol associated with each "Quacked-Up!"
Holiday cache in order to find the bonus cache in the series. You
do not need a trade item to take a duck but:&lt;br id="" /&gt;

&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font color="#FF8000"&gt;This cache has duckies
celebrating the Mexican Fiesta Cinco de Mayo . All of the duckies
are wearing their sombreros, some have instruments to play. All are
ready to party.&lt;br /&gt;
Besides all the ducks there are plenty of fun trinkets to help you
feel like throwing a sombrero on the floor and dancing around and
around.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br id="" /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="#FF8000"&gt;Feel free to trade ... stay with the theme if
you can, but any trade is just fine.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br id="" /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="#FF8000"&gt;Travel bugs and coins always welcome! Bring
the family, kids will especially like the holiday caches (and the
ducks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br id="" /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="#008000"&gt;Depending on where you park this Ducky cache
is a bit more of a walk than the previous ones. It is an easy walk
but since it is a family cache I wanted folks to know it is about
.6 of a mile from the North Parking area and .25 from the South
Parking area.. A small bit of bushwacking is required at the
end.&lt;br /&gt;
Starting with this cache I am including my FTF Duck Crossing Lammy
- who will get the very first one of its kind?&lt;br /&gt;
Big Congrats to the fourulas for their first FTF! I am very excited
for you, I remember the feeling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Much shorter walk, very limited parking.  There is a REAL trailhead here, it is not necessary to go through the metal gates and trespass and bushwack. Trailhead is to the right of those gates, look for trailhead sign and new small wooden bridge.&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Whoa, there! A cache about Monty Python and the Holy Grail, and me without any coconuts? I set my mind to unraveling the mystery and soon came upon the whereabouts of the Grail. I had to convince my companions to join me in the search. 

Once, we had our coconuts in hand, we galloped over hills, rivers and huge tracts of land. We were lucky to not spy any rabbits or monsters of AUGGGGHHHHHH... along our journey. We were worried that we have to search shrubberies along the path and were concerned as who would need to wield the herring! Our search was victorious. Which caused me to shout, I feel happy! since I did not need a beacon to find it! I did however find the contents to be quite wet. As if the French, where drinking from it. Them sons of silly persons! 

I was able to run away from this quest, without any flesh wounds. Thank you, oh Brother... Tim *eyebrow raise*!

P.S. This journey also Included the majestik møøse... A Møøse once bit my sister... No realli! She was Karving her initials on the møøse with the sharpened end of an interspace tøøthbrush given her by Svenge - her brother-in-law - an Oslo dentist and star of many Norwegian møvies: "The Høt Hands of an Oslo Dentist", "Fillings of Passion", "The Huge Mølars of Horst Nordfink"...

I had real trouble with one answer, but was able to guess.  At GZ I found one of the BT hide scenarios that I love to hate.  It took me three orbits before making the find.  Heading back to the car I ran into Mud Dancer.  This is a very small world this evening!  I followed her back to the Grail, and then headed for home.

Round trip is a little over 7ths of a mile. WP 1 is a film canister. Final is a decon pretty well hidden.  Please replace both WP's as found.  In the spring or after heavy rains, WP1 may be a little difficult to get to. You may have to step over a small stream of overflow water. Take a moment to enjoy this spot and think how nice it must have been to travel by rail through this area when the tracks were here.

Best parking is N42 56.380  W077 05.983 On Wheat Rd. 
  I used a Garmin Legend to place this cache for those of you who use other brands, adjust accordingly. 
  A FTF unactivated coin is in the decon.  Has log, but no pencil at this time.

Again a big congradulations to 72CCT-ChT for a FTF on one of my caches!!!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I got part one on the way down the trail, and part two on the way back.  I hadn't planned on caching today, so when I left the house to drive C to work, it didn't seem to matter that I didn't have the right glasses with me.  Then a new cache popped up not too far away, and then, well, 50 miles later, I was still caching.  I got to waypoint 1 and I didn't see a likely spot. I read some logs and determined that the coords were good, so I didn't want to stray too far, but even though water vapor (a.k.a. tons of rain and clouds) are not supposed to interfere with reception, I was having a tough time.  I put away the GPS and went to places that seemed likely to me, and voila!  On the way back, I stopped at the second location.  From the logs, i had an idea of what to look for, but my glasses were spotted with rain, and I was having trouble seeing anything.  I wimped out and decided to paf, and confirmed that my hunch was accurate.  I had to do some finagling, but soon, I had the log in hand. . . woohoo!

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">I had a different spot picked out for this milestone cache, but when another cache was recently archived in this area, I knew this would be an even better location. The Ganargua Creek Meadow Preserve is one of Delta's favorite areas. There's a great view from the cache this time of year when the trees are bare.

For a shorter walk, park at the end of Bunker Hill Rd and start out on the trail. But keep in mind that the cache is at the top of that big hill. It is next to private property. I have the terrain as a 3, because you WILL not trespass on the private property. Right!

If you are going for other caches in the area, there is a trail that runs up/down the hill between the field and the Bunker Hill parking. There's a foot bridge at N43 02.400 W077 20.873 that might be useful. 

For a longer and possibly wet walk (wear boots), park on Wilkinson Rd. and use the foot bridge and trail up the hill.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">No luck today.  My GPS was glitching so I had no info (size, terrain etc.)  I did clamber around a good bit, thinking this was a regular, and although the coords were a bit bouncy, I should have been able to find a GAC.  I guess the GPS really was an issue, and I'm sure the cache is still there, and that I just didn't find it.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was our first time in Garnagua Preserve. We live in Chili and like to explore all kinds of parks and trails--and we are doing Wegmans posts as well as geocaching. And we had three left to do for the Genesee Land Trust passport. Happily found three caches in the preserve. This one took us up the hill. Enjoyed the walk--didn't have the trouble one of the previous cachers had because we followed the excellent trail as far as possible--and had hiking boots and poles and happily the terrain was not sloppy. Congratulations to Delta--put in Buddy Butterfly to bring good luck to anyone associated with the cache--[:)]</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">You know how some caches, well they are just a nice find, and then some you just know will turn into an adventure?  I saved Delta Gold for my 100th cache and it did not disappoint!  I can say with total certainty that it is indeed still there.  There is a big hill involved.  I am not a fan of hills, but the crazy voice "how hard can it be?!" started up and thankfully there was not a satellite camera for America's Funniest Videos watching me.  Up the hill, part way down the hill, no up the hill, across the hill, skidded unintentionally way down the hill, I thanked a lot of little trees for being grab handles, across the hill again, somehow drank 2/3 liter of water going up and down--there are nice places to sit before skidding down again, up hill oh look there's another trail up here!!! skidded down hill again as if I were on skis, windmilling arms and everything, woooo those sticks and leaves sure are slippery! clawed my way back up again and caught my hiking shoe on something and felt it fly off and then tumble quickly downhill, skidded down on one shoe hanging onto trees for dear life, sock still got its fair share of leaf litter, got shoe back on and crawled back up, looked at all obvious spots, wished I'd brought the hiking stick but I probably would have impaled myself on it somehow, paused for another sip of water and wondered when I drank the rest of it, noticed that my hand had several cuts from skidding into trees, then, just as I was about to give up, joy!  If I hadn't been perched so precariously I would have done a happy dance!  Well I got an adventure for my 100, a premium cache to boot, and some great memories--thank you!!!</groundspeak:text>

Solved it last night--checked it--and off A and I went with HopNSeek and Ethan and this was the first cache we did today in an excellent park on a lovely blue sky day--a new park for us too. Ethan got all excited about finding the cache. And earlier--near the parking lot--Ethan and his dad saw a fox! Thanks for this one--definitely a favorite because of the "order" of the elements and why they were ordered that way. Nuf' said.</groundspeak:text>

Today I was out doing some hiking after meeting up with gprgrl. We were caching in the surrounding areas and had to stop for a few more.

We enjoyed the hike and I really liked the new area to explore.  We were able to make it in and out without being detected by the locals so we were both very happy. Got our names in the log and then headed back to the car to go to the next area.

He already had this one but waited for me to take a look.  Found a nearby letterbox first then this sneaky little hide.  Nice!  Grabbed the TB, signed in and replaced.

Nice job with this one!  Thanks for the fun!</groundspeak:text>

Environmental Education students from local area colleges have been creating the trails for this new area.  The trails are clearly marked as are the posted areas.  A neighbor does live close by on one side.  Please use the trails and begin at the trailhead rather than bushwacking.  Or, you may end up in the neighbor's posted area. FYI:  Bug Spray is necessary or you will make a gazillion mosquitoes very happy.

We hope you enjoy this new area.  The students have worked very hard!</groundspeak:long_description>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Team Mc-ie D's Favorite spot...
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The reason we favored this area is because of the history of the
small creek. When grabbing this quick cache, please take the time
to notice the creek; it was a main path way for the underground
railroad, that led many to freedom in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Take a moment to view the area from Google Earth and ponder
yourself having to follow the river to freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Let me close by quoting a few lines from an 1836 "Address" from
Farmington Quarterly Meeting to Quakers in Western New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A mere theoretical belief in Christ is of no avail. Living
faith calls for the exercise of active virtues. The practical
christian... considers all mankind... as his brethren, and himself
under solemn obligations to use all in his power, to ameliorate the
condition of his fellow men, of every color and every condition in
life.... When a plain and positive duty is enjoined, no excuses...
can shield us from responsibility."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations Hutch48 on FTF!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

    <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Think about the past when you are at this area. The first people that lived along Ganargua Creek, the early settlers, and the ones that went on the Underground Railroad. Close your eyes and let the Spirit and the fourth planet from the sun lead the way. Look for the day of the Summer Solstice.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

We've had this puzzle and a couple others near it solved for quite awhile -- so long ago in fact that I don't quite remember how we got from ONONOFFOFFON.....etc. to the success screen from evince.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I was hoping on getting some days off this week with my plan being to grab the backlog of caches I had to find in the area.  This tough puzzle stood in my way of being able to hunt for all the ones I had targeted.  I thought I was making some progress toward the final solution, but I couldn't make it work.  I finally cried uncle, caved in and emailed the CO for a hint.  DD1 was gratious enough to let me know I was on the right track and provided me with what I needed to take that final step.  (Thank you very much!)

Finished a few nearby caches and moved my car to a different parking spot.  Enjoyed my time on the trail and soon arrived at GZ.  Fortunately, the hide fell quicker than the puzzle and I was soon signing the log.  I think I got lucky choosing to go after this now.  I can imagine this would be a lot tougher to find in the middle of summer!

Thanks for the brain workout and for pointing out this area to me!  Nicely done all around.</groundspeak:text>

Yurtles suggested this puzzle as a nice candidate for my blog on that subject (see bookmark) and I enjoyed solving it a while back.  The solution was something I hadn't ever heard of before, and had fun learning enough to get the solve.  We had a nice warm (but not too hot) day to be out for this one, and thoroughly enjoyed the trails in this area.  cheryyll spotted this one quickly and we signed in and were off to the next one.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">After completing the first step of the puzzle I sent hours working on it and was moving nowhere.  Thank you DeltaDelta for the hint that put me back on the right track!  After visiting the EINSTEIN'S CRYPTIC CACHE I decided not to move the car and walked along the creek and then climbed the hill.  Soon I was on the correct trail and quickly came to GZ.  Few minutes searching and I was signing the log.
Thank you for creative puzzle and the hide!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Finished up with "Switches" and moved on down the trail to this one.  "Shift" was just the opposite of the one I had just found...the puzzle fell fairly quickly, the hide not so much.  This location was overflowing with hiding spots, especially for a micro.  I did the only thing I could do: dive in and try to be methodical with my search.  Gave it a good 10 to 15 minutes or so (it's easy to lose track of time when hunting for a cache, so it may have been longer), but the container never jumped into my hand.  Time was starting to run short for me, so I decided to continue on to the End of the Trail cache and give this another shot on my return trip to the car.  That did the trick.  After another 5 or 10 minutes I stumbled onto the sneaky hide.  Very well done!

Thanks for the great puzzle, tricky hide and fun series!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">8th of 23 on the day on a puzzle run to Rochester with cheryyll, and part of the 100 *'s in a day challenge.  Having solved the "Trail with Switches" puzzle a while back, I decided to try to work on the rest of the series in preparation for our trip up here today.  I think this one gave me the most trouble of the bunch, and with time drawing short, I asked the CO for a nudge in the right direction.  It turns out that I was dancing all around the correct method, managing to miss it at every turn.  In hindsight I can see that I might have eventually gotten there on my own, but certainly appreciate the CO helping me out.  We wandered around in circles for a bit trying to locate the cache, before I finally spotted the clever hide.  Signed in and were on our way to the next one.  Thanks for the puzzle and the cache.

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This well maintained trail will take you through the Ganargua Creek Meadow Reserve where new trails and overlooks are still being created. It is an easy walk and it is filled with a variety of wildlife and vegetation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Container is about the size of a matchstick container. Please bring your own pen or pencil. FTF gets a gold one dollar coin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are all kinds of trails to hike on and sometimes they are rocky or have roots along the way. Others are just grass trails and are easy for a walk and others are just very difficult. There was the Trail with Tears. The Cherokee Rose is the symbol of: the Trail Where They Cried.&lt;br /&gt;
Several years ago I was in a museum and saw this bronze sculpture which seemed as how I must have looked and felt at the end of a long day of work. The original sculpture was inspired by a passage from Marion Manville Pope: The trail is lost, the path is hid and winds that blow out the ages sweep me on to that chill borderland where Time's spent sands engulf lost peoples and lost trails. A plaque near the sculpture reads: End of the Trail - James Earle Fraser. The rider and the horse are not tired from a long day at work as the appearance first struck me. They are at the end of a bigger trail.&lt;br /&gt;
James Earle Fraser is famous for something more common though; the design of the Buffalo nickel. The denomination of the Buffalo nickel multiplied times four and add 1 with Caesar will get you a start to get to the end of this trail.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We had DNF'd this cache awhile ago, but no-sleep &amp; I were determined to find it today.  We were surprised how different gz looked with all the new growth.  We looked in a few places before the cache was found, but found it fairly quickly this time.   Very well hidden!  As we were walking away, I realized I had left my sunglasses at gz.  Back again.  Now I can say I am done with G7.

Hate those pesky DNFs, so as soon as I dropped my dad off in Geneva I made a beeline straight over here.  Felt great to get out and walk for a bit after the long car ride, but it felt even better when I found the cache in the third spot I looked.  Woo-hoo!  Since I knew what I was in for I had prepared myself for a long search so I was psyched to have found it so quickly this time.  This is a tricky one to be sure!

The Hamlet of Honeoye is part of the Town of Richmond.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Honeoye - pronounced "honey-oy" is from the Seneca name meaning
"lying finger". The Seneca Indians had a village at the north end
of the lake, until it was destroyed by General John Sullivan's
troops in 1779 during the Sullivan/Clinton Campaign. The troops
built a garrison known as Fort Cummings at the site of the Indian
village.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is the tenth of eleven of the Finger Lakes in size and is the
shallowest, reaching 30 feet at it's deepest point. It is 4.5 miles
in length.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gidegon Pitts, son of Captain Peter Pitts (the first settler in
Richmond) built a home here that is believed to be part of the
Underground Railroad. Helen Pitts, Gidegon's daughter was an
abolitionist and the second wife of Frederick Douglass.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are 2 boat launches, one at the north end at Sandy Bottom
Park, which is open to the public from Wednesday after Labor Day to
June 14 - it is closed in the summer so it can be used by the
Richmond Fire Department for lake rescues. The second launch is the
Honeoye Lake State Boat Launch, located on East Lake Road, 4 miles
south of Route 20A. It is open from May - November and is operated
by NYS Office of Parks &amp;amp; Recreation, a fee is required. You can
find fishermen on the lake in the winter and summer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In 1926, the City of Rochester announced plans to acquire land
around Honeoye Lake and to the north to build a large dam at
Factory Hollow, south of Route 5 &amp;amp; 20 near Lima. The 16 mile
area would be flooded to create a water supply for Rochester. There
was quite an uproar and finally, in 1935, the City of Rochester
reversed it's decision and would acquire water from Lake Ontario
instead.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As part of river otter restoration efforts in New York State, 7
river otters were released at Honeoye Lake in November 2000. The
release was primarily funded by the Finger Lakes Community College
Environmental Conservation Department. Since that time, students
have been monitoring the comeback of the otters to the
lake.</groundspeak:long_description>

On vacation in the Honeoye Lake region (rented a cottage) and decided to go out and explore the area w/ Mrs. Digger.

Mrs. Digger zoned in on this one immediately and had it in hand in seconds flat!  After SL we stuck around to check out the great view.

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The winter of 2012 - 2013 was long and gray. We ( Teamajk, DeltaDelta1, and Yurtles ) coped with the early winter of 2013 by turning our backs on it by solving puzzle caches. Cache puzzles posed by sujojeepers and mcdurr in California and Bumble! in Massachusetts were particularly challenging and educational. Each puzzle we solved was based on a different cipher from this American Cryptogram Association list. Click &lt;a target="_ blank" href="http://www.cryptogram.org/cipher_types.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Now we want to share the fun with you by placing some ACA cipher caches in the Finger Lakes area. Good luck and have fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is not at the posted cache coordinates. You must solve the puzzle to get the coordinates. There are two one dollar gold coins for the first two solver/finders. Please bring your own pencil or pen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To dig on a frigid day there is no better place to experience this than the Arctic tundra. During the peak of summer, you may only be able to dig down a foot or two with a shovel before you hit solid, frozen soil known as permafrost. Jackhammers are often used to dig down further into the permafrost if necessary. Permafrost is found in places where the average annual temperature is below about 23° F. Roots can’t penetrate the frozen soil, so only moss, lichen, and low shrubs can grow there. Fortunately that is not the case here.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">5th stop of my puzzle run between Ithaca and Rochester in my quest to hit cache #999 at the GeoRoc picnic tomorrow.  I didn't have a tool to solve this one completely, but did find one that helped with some of the heavy lifting.  Wracked my brains a bit getting the right combination, and was happy when I got it to work out.  I had cached in this beautiful area before, and had a pleasant walk to the cache, although I was starting to drag a bit by this time, as it was getting late in the day.  The cache was a bit tricky to spot and I was "just" about to call out an SOS when I found it.  Since I usually cache with some geopals, it was reassuring to see that I can indeed make these finds by myself.  Sorry I didn't have more time to spend enjoying this nice area, but I signed in and was off on my quest for the next one.  Thanks for the puzzle and the cache! [:)]</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This is another fine puzzle based on an ACA cypher. While Bruce looked on befuddled, Linda had a good time solving for the coords. This provided the longest walk from parking along a nice grassy trail. All is well here and nicely hidden. Your cammo job on these caches is great, they blend in very well. It was nice to visit a part of this park we have not been to, even spotted a Wegman's Passport Post on the way back to the car. Tried to take the rubbing but it did not work well with our paper or pen. Thanks for the fun, yurtles.</groundspeak:text>

The last thing I wanted to try to do was type a log for this cache on my iPhone...I can't even imagine the words that would be corrected! 

Back in 2010 I somehow got looking at some puzzle caches.  At that point in time I usually stayed away from them. I don't remember how or why, but I saw Trails with Roots and Trails with Squares. The CO of those caches held my hand and helped me get through the caches. I really enjoyed them and had fun finding them.  He then challenged me to grab his other ones.

So I started working on those and emailing him. Who was this guy with all these ciphers?  Ex CIA? Military Intelligence? Some kind of hacker?  I really had no idea but thought the guy was bad a$$ cipher dude.

Well we got to know each other and I got better at puzzles as we both worked on numerous ones. 

So 3 years later this one comes out and I didn't have it in my notification area!  The CO mentioned it and I jumped right on it.  Thanks to his mentoring in doing puzzles over the years I looked at this and spotted the cipher in less than a minute.

A couple hours later I had cords. So for a week I have been sitting on the cords. I was in the area today and told my wife I HAD to get this one.  My mentor and friend put out a puzzle cache and only 2 people have found it.  I made it my mission to find it today and write my log.

The cache location was incredible. I saw all kinds of wild life -  take the time to go the scenic route but watch your step, I stepped into a 2 foot deep hole. I was very happy that I didn't get hurt!

The are was really beautiful and GZ was a lot of fun. I found the cache, made it back to the car and was only 1 1/2 later than I told my wife I would be.  I need to be better aat guessing the time I will be home...

This puzzle was really great. You did a great job giving us a good old school paper and pencil puzzle. It really works the brain to have to do these on paper.

I am fortunate to have been taught how to do puzzles by DeltaDelta1 - I wouldn't be doing them if he hadn't encouraged me and been there to help.  He has also become a good friend and I appreciate the work he put into this. He must have gotten some time in to work on it while his grand daughter took a nap.

This gets a favorite point and I am sure it will get many more.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">A nice tribute. . . we had trouble at the first stage because we were distracted by the location and because the rain was messing with the signal.  C got out his droid and headed right to it!  Then we headed to the final stage.  It started to rain, but I didn't really get wet till I was bent over signing the log. . . then we got drenched!  At least the heavy rain deterred the mosquitoes a bit. Thanks for the fun.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;a href="http://www.victorhikingtrails.org/map/index.php"&gt;Victor
Hiking Trails&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The "Blue and Gold" in the cache title refer to the colored
streamers that temporarily mark the two trails in this area. We
suggest taking one trail in and the other out (the trails converge
again in the woods). The gold trail now ends at Irondequoit Creek
with the Auburn Trail visible a few feet away, but this summer a
bridge will be built connecting the trails.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Access to the trailhead is off the Lehigh Trail with nearest
parking on either Wangum or Phillips Roads.&lt;br /&gt;
NOTE: If you take the Auburn Trail rather than the Lehigh Trail,
YOU WILL HAVE TO CROSS WATER TO GET TO THE CACHE!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first person to find the cache will get a small LED
flashlight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

I was reading the past logs as I was walking, so I had to boomerang back and try it again, as I passed the cache by about 150 feet.  Got to GZ ok, found the blackberry bush (YEAH!) and there were no blackberries left (Boo!).  I could not find anything resembling a cache.  It does not help that I didn't know what I was looking for, and all the plants look strange to me, so that didn't help either.  Thanks for the hike at least.]</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">When I first established this cache a couple of years ago it was in horrible condition. It was overgrown with weeds and thorns and was getting NO maintenance. It was a sad place to visit. I'm happy to say that the Town of South Bristol has taken action and has cleaned the area of scrub brush and erected a split rail fence surrounding it. KUDOS TO THE TOWN!

Here rest the remains of the Founder of the town of South Bristol and veterans of the Revolution, French and Indian wars and the Civil War. 

The container is a clear plastic one liter hydration bottle, clearly marked. To add some happiness to this sad site, I have stocked it with dozens and dozens of Happy Face stickers. Please stick one on (STUCK ON YOU) and leave with a smile as there are no longer any thorn to "stick on you"!</groundspeak:long_description>

Took pictures of some of the headstones, and was surprised to see how overgrown the cemetery once was after seeing earlier pictures of headstones.  It looks so much nicer now.  Thanks for bringing us here.  And TFTC!

I have been leaving sets of guitar picks in several caches, in memory of my very talented blue-eyed musician brother, who always had a popular lively band that by frequent request specialized in Beatles music.

Figured out where we needed to start from and up the hill we went. A snowmobile had been thru before us so that seemed to make the crunchy snow a bit easier to walk on. When we got to GZ, the couple inches of icy snow covering everything made this one a bit more challenging for us, but we cam away with the smiley.  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

We were in this area about a year ago but for some reason I had never loaded all my Bridgebum puzzle solves into the GPS so we missed this one, but we came back today.  We didn't realize this was a multi, so were looking for something quite a bit bigger at WP1, but fortunately N2 found the coords, and then we made our way down the great trail to the final.  We really enjoyed spotting all the St. Nick's somehow has put out along the trail - wonder what that is all about?  We found the final in great shape.  Thanks for the great puzzle, and the nice hike down this wonderful trail system!</groundspeak:text>

Our choices were a roughly 1.4 mile walk on moderately hilly terrain or, what was sure to be a shorter walk on what we figured would be pretty flat terrain.  This one, of course, ended up being the Logical Solution. [;)] We had a pleasant walk in, and LCSM did a great job making both of the finds.  It was starting to get a bit dark as we made our way back out, but we had certainly had a full, fun day.

It's within a few feet of a section of the &lt;a href="http://www.victorhikingtrails.org/map/index.php"&gt;Victor Hiking Trails&lt;/a&gt;. Another possibility is listed below. The cache itself is not far off the trail.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Alert: The following paragraph contains a link to a file containing details needed to find this geocache. As the cache owner, I represent that this file is safe to download although it has not been checked by Groundspeak or by the reviewer for possible malicious content. Download this file at your own risk.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
After you print &lt;a href="http://www.drivehq.com/file/df.aspx/publish/bridgebum/PublicFolder/filled.pdf"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; out, you'll need some scissors and a glue stick to figure out the real coordinates. The cache is a 30 cal. ammo can filled with trade items. There's also a small wooden puzzle as a first to find prize. No night caching, please, as part of the trail passes close to homes.&lt;br /&gt;

This cache idea was shamelessly stolen from &lt;b&gt;Ottertrotters&lt;/b&gt;, who generously helped us to modify his original to suit our needs.&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Finally solved the puzzle a few days ago, in preparation for a Memorial Day trip back to Rochester to visit friends. I remember this puzzle coming out about a week before we moved away, back in 2011. I tried it then, but my head must've been full of moving details on top of work, and I managed to misplace the paperwork before I got very far with it. This time, oddly enough, it was no trouble at all. I love the hidden trails running all through Victor, and the trail to the cache felt especially covert. Lots of birds to serenade me on my walk, with a few rabbits as furtive escorts. Thanks for the hike and the cache!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I took a walk down this hidden little trial today to do this cache.  This proved to be quite difficult, I am guessing when it was placed the growth was less but at this stage of the summer it was very overgrown and made each WP quite a challenge.  The third in particular was so grown over that I had to do a wee bit of landscaping to make it possible to search.  Anyway it was a challenge and I was glad to make it to the final which is in fine shape.

Thanks for the cache and for showcasing a quiet trail I bet few people know about.

I got to parking ok by drivign past a few DO NOT ENTER signs.  I got to stage 1 and saw a perfect spot for a cache.  But it was 50 feet off.  I checked it anyway.  I then went to the GZ shown on the GPSr, and still came up empty.  I decided to take a walk down the path to see if I could find any of the other stages.  I found a few nice hiding spots, but they were all empty too.  Bummer.  Maybe I can find this one before I leave.</groundspeak:text>

We have seen this spot and questioned whether there was a trail here.  Great little trail - who knew!!  I guess Pep did :)  We found the first waypoint and were off on our way to the second.  Then no luck!  We searched and searched, but couldn't seem to spot it!  We decided to continue on the trail with hopes to spot a likely GZ and Voila, there it was!  We were so psyched!

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Welcome to Pep's Place. A nice walk along a trail on private property. Access to this area is only allowed from dawn to dusk. Please pay attention to the parking coordinates.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Pep has been looking for a place to get away from it all and I found just the spot. A place in the woods with a babbling stream nearby and some room to spread out. Gorgeous views abound and with the built-in skylight star gazing is a must. This place needs a little work but with a little work it will be as good as new.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache will be an easy find for most experienced cachers. From the parking area follow the trail and you will find your way to the cache. There is no need to enter the structure and I recommend that you don't. You are looking for a 30 cal ammo can.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is placed on private property with the permission of the owner. Please be respectful of the area.

Got to GZ and had my phone with a questionable signal and no GPS with me, so took us some floundering around a little before Taz took pity and nudged us in the right direction. Found it quickly after that. Signed in, grabbed the TB and jumped back on the Gator for the ride back. Some very nice property here, thanks for the ride and tftc. :)</groundspeak:text>

&lt;img src="http://www.drivehq.com/file/df.aspx/publish/bridgebum/PublicFolder/flexagons/title.jpg" border="0" height="250" width="500" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Flexagons are folded pieces of paper that can be flexed to reveal faces other than the original front and back. There are many different varieties of flexagons. The concept was discovered in 1939 by Arthur Stone, a British mathematician studying at Princeton. He and several of his friends (including Richard Feynman, who years later won the Nobel Prize in physics) formed an group to study these curiosities. This so called "Princeton Flexagon Committee" devised ways to make flexagons with up to 48 faces.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In order to find this cache, you'll need to construct (and flex) a trihexaflexagon, a relatively simple version that is 6-sided with three different faces.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Alert: The following paragraph contains links to files containing details needed to find this geocache. As the cache owner, I represent that these files are safe to download although they have not been checked by Groundspeak or by the reviewer for possible malicious content. Download these files at your own risk.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You'll need scissors and a glue stick. First print &lt;a href="http://www.drivehq.com/file/df.aspx/publish/bridgebum/PublicFolder/flexagons/flexagon.pdf"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; page, and follow &lt;a href="http://www.drivehq.com/file/df.aspx/publish/bridgebum/PublicFolder/flexagons/creating.pdf"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; directions to build your flexagon. Once that's done, you'll need to 'flex' your flexagon to reveal information about the coordinates. The flexing technique is easier shown than described. Click on the 'Related Web Page' link above to see how it's done. Depending on which side of the flexagon you're looking at, you may or may not get useful information!&lt;br /&gt;

Please rehide the cache carefully!&lt;br /&gt;

The only thing she didn't do was glue the loose ends together. Boy what a difference that made! After a few folds and flips I had the coordinates. In fact, the puzzle was easier than the hide. Your camouflage works very well here. As always, this was a very enjoyable geocache. Thanks bridgebum!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">10th of our record 40 in a day.   Wow, did we look like crazies at this cache!  I personally carried three "tools" just in case and Raggedy Andy had one, too.  I plowed through my first one and it all happened so fast that we lost all opportunity to retrieve the cache.  The second one fared even worse and then I got worried because I surely didn't want to walk back up that hill twice (read: lazy).  So the third time we worked better as a team and made it happen.  GREAT CACHE!  You have earned yet another favorite point today.  Well done!!  Thank you for the fun.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;br /&gt;
Percy MacMahon (1854-1929) was a British mathematician who also dabbled in puzzles. One of the things he came up with is known as &lt;b&gt;MacMahon Squares&lt;/b&gt;. If you take a square and draw the diagonals on it, it can be viewed as composed of 4 triangular segments. And if each one of those segments is one of three possible colors, it would be possible to create 24 different squares. &lt;img src="http://www.drivehq.com/file/df.aspx/publish/bridgebum/PublicFolder/psquares.jpg" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Alert: The following two paragraphs contain links to files containing details needed to find this geocache. As the cache owner, I represent that these files are safe to download although they have not been checked by Groundspeak or by the reviewer for possible malicious content. Download these files at your own risk.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Percy figured out that it was possible to arrange the 24 squares such that the edges of adjacent squares always match in color AND the outside edge is always a single color.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.drivehq.com/file/df.aspx/publish/bridgebum/PublicFolder/one_solution.pdf"&gt;Here's&lt;/a&gt; one solution that follows his rules. It turns out that there are 13,328 of them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, what does that have to do with this cache?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.drivehq.com/file/df.aspx/publish/bridgebum/PublicFolder/partial_solution.pdf"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a (different) &lt;b&gt;partial&lt;/b&gt; solution. You'll want to print it out. And get out your scissors - &lt;a href="http://www.drivehq.com/file/df.aspx/publish/bridgebum/PublicFolder/missing_squares.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; are the squares necessary to complete the solution and figure out the coordinates.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is hidden at &lt;b&gt;N43 0A.BCD W077 2E.FGH&lt;/b&gt;. It is a medium sized camo'ed lock-n-lock containing some pins to trade. The cache is located not far from a trail, so bushwhacking should not be necessary.&lt;br /&gt;

Last night she came to me all proud and showed me the solved puzzle. I was really impressed. She has started to take an interest in these puzzle caches, and I can definitely use the help. Great job Suzy!

The hide itself was relatively easy, but all of the leaves made it a bit harder to find. I'm glad I attempted this one before the snow flies. Thank you for another excellent puzzle and cache.

We've filled it with a variety of toy dinos.  Feel free to take them.  If you wish to add something to the box please try to keep with the theme and leave something relating to the prehistoric beasts.  Along the way check out the wonderful views of the creek flowing by the trail.  You may even spot some fossilized critters in the rocks by the creek.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please hide the cache exactly as you found it. No more. No less.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Decided to not take the obvious trail for the first part of the approach, "just because" I guess.  Once at GZ I wandered around a bit and then final saw the pretty decorated container.

We had a pleasant walk getting close to this one and then fought our way in through the prickers to where we needed to be.

   <groundspeak:short_description html="False"> Between Old Dutch rd. &amp; Wangam Rd. No bushwacking, no poison ivy, no thorny stuff. moderate hills &amp; well maintained trails.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The listed coordinates lead to a stone historical marker, PABOS.  He was an early Basque explorer who came here looking for the Northwest Passage. The cache, for all you Geo explorers, is located in Fishers Park which has 3 Trailheads, E, N, &amp; W. This park is also accessible from the Lehigh or Auburn bike trails. Best parking is at the East trailhead by the tennis courts where you’ll need to find the first marker.
To find the second marker use this formula from data on the plaque:  
N 43° 00.A    Where A=(# of feet away Pabos is buried) + 38
W 77° 28.B    Where B=(the year of death) – 905

At the second marker you will need to use this formula to find the cache:
N 43° 00.C    Where C=(Hawk Childs year of birth) - 1613
W 77° 28.D    Where D=(year of death) –1395
While here enjoy the view, respect the tranquility, take pictures, look for a small metal dolphin, a metal sculpture (what is it?) &amp; the large stone arrow beyond (What is it pointing at?).  
The cache is a 30 cal. Ammo box with lots of shinny &amp; practical trinkets an explorer might use to trade with the Indians. TB’s are welcome. 


Additional Waypoints</groundspeak:long_description>
    <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Look for the Hawks nest.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="False">Welcome! This cache is part of a small series of caches we have come up with where in order to sign the log, you NEED to have something with you that's more than just a pen or pencil.

This cache is placed along part of a new and still developing trail in Victor. Please be respectful of your surroundings.  There is plenty of nearby parking.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">We name all our caches after song titles and "Monkey Wrench" by The Foo Fighters is a great choice for this cache.  We both love The Foo Fighters and this is one of many songs by the band we enjoy listening to.

Finding this cache is only 1/2 of the fun with this adventure. The other 1/2 is being able to sign the log. We hope you have at least 1/2 as much fun finding it as we did hiding it. Please re-hide the cache exactly as you found it. 

For the FTF:  A new unactivated Geocoin  (We also dropped a few pathtags for the next few finders as well)

Congrats to: TheDonnerParty for their FTF

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">PANORAMIC PATHWAY

This is located on the MOST SCENIC portion of the Ontario Pathways Trail System, a must-do section of the Pathway. “Rails to Trails” has been successful in providing countless miles of good, safe, leisurely hiking. Unfortunately, most of these miles can be very boring – just a narrow ribbon of pathway between swamps and cornfields. Ontario Pathways Trail System is that way for a good portion of its 23 miles. Not here! You will find rapids, waterfalls, and stately bridges on your short walk. Flint Creek winds and rushes its way through this section and provides impressive views for such a small stream. 

This was, at first, a multi-. But (unknowingly) A Tribute To A Wedding was within 100 ft of my first site. So you know this must be an interesting spot to visit.

After hiking the trail visit the Phelps Niagara Cache in the nearby Village of Phelps to fully appreciate its power. You might first seek out CB’s Birthday Cache and The Ontario Pathways Cache (a multi-) located on this section of trail and the adjoining one. 

The best parking is at the Rte 96 trailhead. 

Do this cache after a recent rain so the water is moving at its best. Keep in mind however, too heavy a rain or melt could result in a “hot foot” when approaching the caches. The caches themselves are high enough above the stream to stay dry and the cache areas generally remain clear. 

If you try the cache in winter keep in mind that these trails have recently been opened to snowmobile traffic.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This is such a beautifully maintained trail! We enjoyed our time exploring it while camping in the area nearby. JH followed the GPS while KH yelled at her to come back because of the posted sign. Whoops -- didn't see it. However, JH was in the right area, and in the end it was KH who was brave enough to go in and make the find. The sign made us a bit uncomfortable, but it was really hard to tell to which area it pertained. Glad we came away with a smiley. :-)

We rectified that, saw a couple hardy souls grilling in the park (it was up in the 20's today) and we found our way to GZ. This would have been much tougher if there had been more snow. Log must have been wet, cause it was frozen in the container. Warmed it up enough to gently removed, dried container a bit and hid as found. TFTC</groundspeak:text>

After studying the situation, we walked along the road until we were straight out from the cache and then followed the geo trail to GZ.

behold! Can be done anytime of the year, but great for winter since
you don't even have to get out of the car.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Many local legends abound about this hill and most of the local
folks in the area know about this unusual piece of land. Be sure to
take along these instructions so you know why this place is
special. 
&lt;p&gt;Stop your car at the cache coordinates. NOTE: Be sure you are
facing SOUTH! If you are not, this probably will not work as well.
You might notice nothing very unusual here. You are parked on a
hill and of course one way is up and the other down. Now, put your
car's transmission in neutral. There is the surprise! Which way did
your car roll? The spooks are at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Requirement: In order to log this cache, please take a photo and
post it here. Photo is to be taken looking South with you and/or
your GPS unit in the photo. This is necessary in order to meet
geocaching.com requirement for Virtual Cache. Thank You.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

This is one of the prettier areas on the trail as you get a good look at the creek. &lt;br /&gt;
Be on the look out for fisherman here as this is a favorite fishing spot.&lt;br /&gt;
This trail system use to be a railway bed.  Now cleaned up and maintained, it is a nice level trail for easy walking or bike riding. &lt;br /&gt;
At the trail head in Phelps there is information and pictures about the history of the system.&lt;br /&gt;

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Shuman Cemetery.  This cemetery is named for &lt;span style="line-height:1.6em;"&gt;Jacob Shuman (most likely originally spelled Schumann), a man said to have been a Hessian soldier during the Revolution who was captured as a prisoner of war and never went home afterward. It is certain that he came to Potter from Pennsylvania and was joined by other ethnic Germans from the same state. Still later a large group of Alsatian families arrived and the whole neighborhood was known as the Dutch Settlement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Hessians&lt;/strong&gt; were 18th-century &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germans_in_the_American_Revolution" title="Germans in the American Revolution" style="text-decoration:none;color:rgb(11, 0, 128);background-image:none;background-position:initial initial;background-repeat:initial initial;"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; soldiers hired through their rulers by the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire" title="British Empire" style="text-decoration:none;color:rgb(11, 0, 128);background-image:none;background-position:initial initial;background-repeat:initial initial;"&gt;British Empire&lt;/a&gt;. About 30,000 German soldiers served in the Thirteen Colonies during the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War" title="American Revolutionary War" style="text-decoration:none;color:rgb(11, 0, 128);background-image:none;background-position:initial initial;background-repeat:initial initial;"&gt;American Revolutionary War&lt;/a&gt;; nearly half were from the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesse" title="Hesse" style="text-decoration:none;color:rgb(11, 0, 128);background-image:none;background-position:initial initial;background-repeat:initial initial;"&gt;Hesse&lt;/a&gt; region of Germany; the others came from similar small German states. In the context of the British service, they were all referred to as "Hessians." The American colonists called them &lt;a class="mw-redirect" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercenaries" title="Mercenaries" style="text-decoration:none;color:rgb(11, 0, 128);background-image:none;background-position:initial initial;background-repeat:initial initial;"&gt;mercenaries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were hired in units, not as individuals. They received wages, but the prince of their respective states received most of the funds; Britain found it easier to borrow money to pay for their service than to recruit its own soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The British used the Hessians in several conflicts, including in Ireland, but they are most widely associated with combat operations in the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War" title="American Revolutionary War" style="text-decoration:none;color:rgb(11, 0, 128);background-image:none;background-position:initial initial;background-repeat:initial initial;"&gt;American Revolutionary War&lt;/a&gt;. They provided extensive manpower to support the American Loyalist cause. The pro-independence side made propaganda use of the fact that the soldiers were non-British,and portrayed them as mercenaries. They also offered them land bounties to desert and join the Americans. Several more German units were placed on garrison duty in the British Isles to free up British regulars for service in North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johann Nicholas Bahner(t), one of the Hessians captured in the Battle of Trenton, indicate that some of the Hessian soldiers were told they were needed to defend the American Colonies against Indian incursions. When they arrived in North America, they discovered they had been hired to fight against the British colonists, rather than the Indians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The geocache is a simple container hidden in the bushes.  There is a log book and some trade items.  Please trade fairly.  Please bring your own pen.  I might not have put one in the cache. As this cache is in a cemetery please only search for it during daylight hours. The cache is not placed near any markers.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
    <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Its just on the ground under the bushes.  You might need to crawl under to get it.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">His wife was celebrated with "Ode to Doe" (amongst other hides), so
we thought it would be nice to let Buck have an "Ode" of his own. 
&lt;p&gt;So here it is... sing along to any tune you want...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="+0" color="#A0522D"&gt;Ode to Wandering
Buck&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="+0" color="#A0522D"&gt;There once was a Buck named
Wandering,&lt;br /&gt;
How to properly celebrate his 1K, we’ve been pondering.&lt;br /&gt;
Finally came up with a plan,&lt;br /&gt;
We've hidden a golden can&lt;br /&gt;
So go caching, and have fun while out squandering!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please note: We have worked hard to hide this cache in a special
place to honor our deer friend. Do enjoy the hunt, but please don't
write anything in your log online or upload pictures of the
surroundings of ground zero to spoil the fun for future finders.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cache is starting out with items that make noise to help celebrate
Wandering Buck's 1000th. Also there is a lammy for the FTF. &lt;br /&gt;

She had already found this one and wanted me to find it also because it is so funny!  It was a short hike through the park and the woods and I came upon it.  What a hoot!  I picked up "Tracker The Labrador" and will be placing it in a new home soon.  TFTC.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Camped nearby for the weekend. We decided to get out and do some caching before the rain hit. Managed to make it all the way down to Sparky's Dino Cache and back without getting wet! This is one of the most beautiful trails we have encountered. We enjoyed our time here! As for the hide, KH was able to make quick work of the find. Another location we would not have known about were it not for caching. Thanks for sharing it!

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Out working the dog today I came across this lovely patch of woods.
Gnarly trees and old Cherries abound in this parcel.
Buck rubbings etc are in evidence so watch your step.

Boots will probably be a good idea. Especially in the spring.
This container is 3 inches long and 3/4 in diameter.
Bring your own pen.
Park Closes at Dusk.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">6th cache of the day... 2nd TheTillyHat ever.  Made short work of the puzzle last night.  I had the answers, but when staring at them did me no good a friend stepped in with a save.  I obviously wasn't thinking puzzly enough. 

I'm (just) too young to know the movie (sorry), but I found the clip to be quite entertaining.  Maybe enough to get my husband to watch the movie with me.  Time will tell.

As for the cache, the trail was beautiful - we enjoyed it quite a bit. Raggedy Andy spotted the cache slightly further off trail than I was looking.  I was glad he was with me. What a great find!

Thanks for giving us some cool hides for our 2nd annual Father/Daughter day out.</groundspeak:text>

Enjoyed the hike with Elocon along these newer trails, and we were able to come up with the hide. Sadly Elocon had to get back to work so we ran out of time to do the other couple caches in the area.  Will be back! Thanks for the fun one Tilley!

I solved this pretty quick but never went out for it.  Today was my day off.  My wife wasn't feeling well and said she was going to take a nap.  It was raining, so my only option was to go caching.

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This multi-cache takes you on a little tour of Honeoye. This is my first hide. Please do not do this at night, the final is in a park open from sunrise to sunset. Dogs allowed on leash.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first waypoint is located in a small park, right in town. You will need to obtain information from the War Memorial and the plaque on the Gazebo for the next waypoint.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Waypoint #2 - N 42 46.ABC W077 30.DEF&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A = Number of Civil War Veterans killed in action&lt;br /&gt;
B = Number of times the first name of James is listed under World War II Veterans&lt;br /&gt;
C = Number of female Korean Veterans + 8&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now go to the "Out of the ashes..." plaque on the Gazebo&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
D = Number of times Deats appears on the plaque + 1&lt;br /&gt;
E = First number in the day of the month the park was rededicated.&lt;br /&gt;
F = Number of Other Contributors - 11&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You will now have the information required to find Waypoint #2&lt;br /&gt;
You can drive to the next waypoint or walk, the Trailhead for Sandy Bottom Trail is listed below, it is about .12 mile from where you are now. The total walk is about 1.25 miles.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The second waypoint will bring you to two signs, please use the larger sign to obtain the coordinates.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These coordinates are different from the original final, needed to move the final so it will not get muggled (hopefully). Final - N 42 47.GHI W077 30.JKL&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
G = Number of lines on the white portion of the sign - 1&lt;br /&gt;
H = Add first and second number of local law subsec.&lt;br /&gt;
I = Third number of local law sec.&lt;br /&gt;
J = Night time speed - 2&lt;br /&gt;
K = Number of towns mentioned in sign&lt;br /&gt;
L = Sign posted courtesy of _______ Valley Association - how many letters in missing word.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Be sure to take a few minutes to enjoy the view from the second waypoint before heading off to the final.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No bushwacking required. Since this has been mugged twice, just a log book and pencil in the cache. Please return it exactly where you found it. Thanks! The trail loops around, if you have time, walk all the way around.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hope you enjoy your tour.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Congratulations to TazD on FTF&lt;br /&gt;

BLUES" - Geocaching Series&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;The cache is
starting off with a log book and a pencil. The container is large
enough to hold trackables. Park in the adjacent parking lot and
begin your search.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;I must give all
the credit to the creation of this cache series to my
wife.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;This is the
first cache in our "Don't Get The Blues" - (DGTB) series. The theme
is very simple. In this area, winter caching can become quite
unnerving at times, and leave you with "The Blues". This series of
caches has been designed to allow everyone to find caches during
the winter months and not leave you "Feeling the Blues"&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The
only rules that you must remember are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The
caches are all winter accessible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The
cache title will begin with DGTB - and have a song title with
"Blue" in it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The
cache can be found regardless if there is 3ft. of snow or no snow
at all.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;Every cache
will present it's own challenges as to how it will be found...some
will be quite easy, others will be harder....In the end we hope
this will sustain everyone through the winter months until the
frost breaks.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;As always we name
our caches after song titles. "Blue Christmas" was appropriate
since it's the first cache in this series and it was also placed on
Christmas Day. Several artists have performed this song, but we
always remember the Johnny Mathis &amp; Elvis Presley versions.
(Please see related web page link at the top of our
listing).&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;Enjoy!!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;For the FTF We
have left an unactivated FTF coin.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;Congrats to

The log book is still signable, but quite wet.  The CO may wish to visit and replace the o-ring and contents, as the cache itself seems to be doing well otherwise.  Great container!

Also of note:  The Little Green Machine TB is not in the cache.  You may already know this, but the CO has the ability to mark TBs missing.

I apparently passed my final "tick check" after I returned home from our long adventure, so all is well.

While I feel that Geocaching.com should hold the location for you and block other caches from entering the area around this cache for a reasonable amount of time, we can't do so forever. Please either repair/replace this cache, or archive it (using the [i]archive listing[/i] link in the upper right) so that someone else can place a cache in the area, and geocachers can once again enjoy visiting this location.

If you plan on repairing this cache, please [b]log a note to the cache[/b] (not email) within the next 30 days so I don't archive the listing for non-communication.

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;  I often take my dog ZACK for walks up in this area.  He simply goes crazy because of the scent of the deer and squirrils that frequent this area.  I have therefore, named this cache "Krazee-Dawg-ZACK".  This should be easy to get to and easy to find for any geocacher.  If there has been rain, you may have to dodge a couple mud puddles, but otherwise it is an easy walk for all ages.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The container is a 14" green metal fishing box with an official geo-caching label and the name Krazee-Dawg-ZACK on it.  It has been placed in a clear plastic bag to protect against the elements.  It has a multiple of fun trade items.  It contains a two dollar bill from our friends North of the boarder for the FTF.  It is also starting two trackables.  Please help them start their mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is located near the Macedon Cemetary established in 1861.  It provides a piece of history of days long ago as depicted on the head stones.  The cache is &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt; hidden by any of the headstones.   You may park on any of the cemetary roads, but please be respectful should a funeral be in process.  Enjoy the screneity and peacefulness of this area.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;td style="vertical-align:top;border:none;padding:4px 10px;"&gt;The dominant spirit, however, that haunts this enchanted region, and seems to be commander-in-chief of all the powers of the air, is the apparition of a figure on horseback, without a head. It is said by some to be the ghost of a Hessian trooper, whose head had been carried away by a cannon-ball, in some nameless battle during the Revolutionary War, and who is ever and anon seen by the country folk hurrying along in the gloom of night, as if on the wings of the wind. His haunts are not confined to the valley, but extend at times to the adjacent roads, and especially to the vicinity of a church at no great distance ... the body of the trooper having been buried in the churchyard, the ghost rides forth to the scene of battle in nightly quest of his head, and that the rushing speed with which he sometimes passes along the Hollow, like a midnight blast, is owing to his being belated, and in a hurry to get back to the churchyard before daybreak.&lt;/td&gt;

It was a little hairy for a few moments, but otherwise, we made it work.  Easier to spot than to retrieve.  Thanks so much for the fun!  This section of town was our favorite part of the day.

Of note:  The connection device was broken and appears to have been redone by finders, as we attempted.  It's holding it's own, but barely.  If we had anything suitable with us, we would have tried a better fix, but alas, it's an item not carried in our trail bags (yet).  Thanks, again!</groundspeak:text>

This one popped up on our radar and we decided to go for it.  Interesting area!  We were not sure about the water level as we had some major rain fall recently, but luckily we were able to cross without too much trouble.  Glad we both had on the right shoes, unlike our last outing in flip flops.  Fun hide!  We signed in and headed off to the next.  Thanks for another nice TTH cache.</groundspeak:text>

I avoided the quicksand but a vine grabbed me and almost pulled me down. I did feel a bit like Indiana Jones at this one. Vines and bugs and quicksand....

You would think that with putting out a zillion caches they may get boring but Tilley seems to get better with age. I have really enjoyed the non stop caches and am working hard to catch up...

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">It was a nice sunny morning so headed out to get this cache.  Found good parking on Fishers Rd at the trail crossing. (N43 00.994 W077 28.300).  Looks like a new parking area, big enough for two cars.  This made the walk only .23 mile.  But I gotta say, it was such a nice walk, that I wouldn't have minded going further.  The cache took me a few minutes to find and there were no trackables in it.  Enjoyed the beautiful view (must be nice to have gobs of money).  I'm giving this a favorite point, because I enjoyed it so much.</groundspeak:text>

I had to use my car key to sign the log. It is light, but legible. Thank you for the hide. I like this series.

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">There is VERY good parking at the Indian Hill Trail Head Parking
Area just off of Route 31 east of Turk Hill Road. I know of NO
other good parking that you can access the trails from without
crossing POSTED land (PLEASE make the hike and DON’T take the short
way a crossed someone’s yard.) Posted hours are 8:00am to Dusk
Please be respectful of them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
REMEMBER YOU ARE GUEST on the trail system………&lt;br&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Not a park and grab. A wonderful 2 mile hike (one way) brings you
along the Yellow to the Blue and on to the Orange trails of the
Crescent Trail System to the area of GZ. This well maintained trail
system winds it way through private property so PLEASE stay on the
WELL marked trails. The cache is within arms length (well…. maybe
two) of the trail so no need to venture off the trail to find the
cache. I averaged over 450 readings to get the coords for the hide,
but even though my Garmin said less than 10 feet averaged to the
cache it maybe a bit more. I was getting 15 to 18 foot accuracy all
evening, but I was off 20 to 40 feet from all the caches in the
area that I stopped by and checked on. The cache is a cammoed
Altoids tin starting off with a RED JEEP taped to it, a scrap of
paper for a log and a Steel Penny Signature item. NO PEN OR PENCLE
SO PLEASE BRING YOUR OWN. I did not have my standard FTF prize of a
GOLDEN $1 coin with me so there is an IOU out for the FTF and I
will get it to the FTF after the find somehow.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Have FUN and remember your GUEST status…………&lt;br&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Greetings!

I noticed that your cache has the needs maintenance attribute set.  This is generally caused when a cacher posts a "needs maintenance log on  your cache for a number of reasons.  If you have addressed the issue or believe there is no issue, you can remove this attribute by posting an "owner maintenance" log, or editing the attribute list to remove it (note on caches other than traditional, the needs maintenance icon does not show, but clicking "Update Attributes" will clear it anyway.)

Often people will filter out caches that require maintenance so making sure this is correct will help cachers find your cache.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Decided to come in here today with Spooko13.  We opted for the 2 car plan and were we glad!  This was our first stop and the most difficult of all the caches we did. Very well hidden.  It was right where we expected it to be, but we still had problems. After a quick PAF to make sure we were not missing something we went back to double check our searching and came up with it. SO close but so far...

Great hide and what a trail!</groundspeak:text>

The only problem with that was it is straight up a steep hill. I stopped at least 3 times. The path was well used. My lungs are not well used. Nice area to hike. Peaceful. Noticed a deer stand close to ground zero. Keep that in mind. I need to buy some orange clothes. tftc. Took TB.</groundspeak:text>

We still had some time &amp; energy left, so did a little caching   . . .   working toward my 500 milestone.  I agree with other cachers in that it was an easy find, but a very prickly tree.  This was the 1st of 6 we found today.  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;
Since the beginning of time there was always a curiosity about what the fundamental substances were, how and why things worked, or even how encryptic messages were sent. Einstein, DaVinci and many others including Presidents were those who sought answers to such things.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Things were always in some order and when chemist Demitri Mendeleev made his first Periodic Table, the arrangements of the elements were in such a way that he left spaces in the Table for new elements and yet-to-be discovered ones. For his creation of the Periodic Table the element Mendelevium was named after him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Promethium, Aluminum, Palladium, Platinum, Einsteinium, Manganese, Polonium, Rubidium, Tellurium&lt;/p&gt;

Had the coords. for a while(with help of course) and decided to finally grab this one the way home from work.  Came in the hard way and was not prepared for the obstacle.  I did what was needed but was still nervous with all the gun play off in the distance.   Didn't know if this area extended this far back or if there were hunters lurking about.  Took the hard way back after signing the log and enjoyed a nice stroll back to the car.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">In my race to get a cache before we had to run out to a Margaritaville party, I misread this cache as a Tilly cache, and in the bouncing signal I had, took quite a circuitous route--away from the Obvious, mind you--thru the field, toward the creek, towards a tree I was concerned I might have to climb in Crocs no less, past a well-used woodchuck hole, tree got a good shake and grope, over some rocks, and, Well lookee there! right back to the Obvious!  Then, standing there burning up in the sunshine--Vitamin D, check--OH Tilly was the FTF!!! Park and grab?! NO WAY!!!  Then--despite the GIANT spiderweb I could have gotten tangled up in, and a lackadaisical yellow jacket who could have told me to get offa his lawn--found the cache quickly and without further incident.  Thank you trckey2 for a great cache-dash that I somehow managed to build quite a little adventure around!  And it kept my 24 day streak going woo hoo!  TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="False">Follow the orange Crescent Trail in Perinton, NY for about a third of a mile, depending on the entry point. The trail is a little hilly and may be somewhat muddy in low sections in wet weather. One entry point is off Neuchatel near N 43 02.603 W 77 26.532.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The cache is a camo-covered snap-n-lock container of moderate size that is seeded with the usual small trade items and a dollar coin for FTF. There is room for small items and trackable items.

The trail is heavily wooded so the GPS coordinates may be somewhat variable. The GPS claimed it was within 16 feet, but the tree cover makes that a little suspect.

It is seeded with Travel Bug Z3N170 brought to our lovely trails from Minnesota. Please take it to another cache to continue its travels.

   <groundspeak:short_description html="False">The cache is located in Prospect Hill Park in Palmyra. GPS signal is poor here, so common sense will be needed to locate the cache. There is a fairly steep climb, but it is on a gravel road until you are about 75' from the cache. It is very buggy, and there may be poison ivy. No major bushwhacking is required.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Prospect Hill is my favorite area in Palmyra. I think this is the perfect spot to commemorate Dakboy's recent achievement of 1000 cache finds. I have contemplated many different areas to place this. Once Dakboy referred to Palmyra as "our little corner of heaven" it struck me that I had to place this close to home. I have not had the opportunity to meet Dakboy yet, but we have conversed via email a few times, so as far as I'm concerned, that makes me qualified to hide his golden ammo can. 

Enjoy the hike, and congrats to Dakboy!!!

Update: I have replaced the stolen ammo can with a Lock N Lock, something I hate to do, but I do not want another can stolen.

You can park right nearby, but should not try to park along the main road.  Please use your best geocaching subtlety here as there are muggles with long-range cameras and badges watching this area.  There is only room for log paper, so bring your own pencil or pen.  I hope it provides a nice break from shopping nearby.

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache can easily be done on foot or by bicycle if you like.  You will cover 10 to 12 kilometers (6 or 7 miles) round trip.

The waypoints leading up to the final are magnetic keycases.  The final is not too difficult to find, however you will have to bushwack for a short distance.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Welp - this one turned into a two day excursion for me as there was a caretaker at WP2 who had just started mowing, and watering, and puttering, and picking up litter, and resting, and starting all over at the next section. I killed as much time as I could but he never left my line of sight so I was unable to do what needed to be done to snag the final waypoints. I came back today, and the place looked great, and I had the place to myself. I snagged the very well hidden final waypoints, and made my way to the final. I also had to spend longer than I should have there because of the DENSE undergrowth, thorns, etc. It's so nice to have this one off my list. TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">The cache is NOT hidden at the posted coordinates! You must crack the cipher below to find the real coordinates.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Cachers of a certain age may remember Tom Lehrer, an American singer-songwriter, satirist, pianist, and mathematician.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lehrer earned his AB in mathematics (magna cum laude) from Harvard University in 1947 at age nineteen, and received his MA degree the next year. He taught classes at MIT, Harvard, and Wellesley. Tom remained in Harvard's doctoral program for several years, taking time out for his musical career and to work as a researcher at Los Alamos and at the National Security Agency. In later years, Tom taught political science, mathematics, and musical theater at various universities.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lehrer's musical work typically focused on political and social commentary. He often parodied popular songs, as in &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFIvXVMbII0"&gt;"The Elements"&lt;/a&gt; which sets the names of the chemical elements to the tune of the "Major-General's Song" from Gilbert and Sullivan's Pirates of Penzance. Written in 1959, the song was up to date for its time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In 1980, 28 of Lehrer's songs were made into a musical revue that ran successfully in London and New York. The revue was called "Tom Foolery," which inspired the name of this cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Although Tom's audiences (including Queen Elizabeth II and viewers of the American TV Show That Was The Week That Was) enjoyed his performances, some critics were less than impressed:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mr. Lehrer's muse is not fettered by such inhibiting factors as taste." — The New York Times&lt;br /&gt;
"Plays the piano acceptably" — The Oakland Tribune&lt;/blockquote&gt;
For a final bit of trivia, consider this: Weird Al Yankovic credits Tom Lehrer as one of his musical influences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A number of Tom's songs have been published by (no surprise here) Dr. Demento.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Okay, enough about Tom. On to the puzzle:&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
This cache was inspired by DeltaDelta1's &lt;a href="http://coord.info/GC3CAMF"&gt;EINSTEIN'S CRYPTIC CACHE&lt;/a&gt;, however the cipher used in this puzzle is NOT the same!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache contains 3 shiny new $1 President coins, one for each of the first three finders.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Congratulations to First Solver/First Finder KK2005! Great work and I'm sorry it took a face full of snow for you to see the light!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I got a LOT of help on this puzzle and came by today with Durf's Breakfast Crew. It seems like we are heading back out here every couple of weeks lately, but I'm always happy to do so in such good company.

Someday I aspire to be able to solve these kinds of puzzles all by myself. In the meantime, I'm glad to have friends who can. Thanks for the fun.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Wow, it feels like I was just here.  Actually I think I was, for a different puzzle cache.  Came out today with the breakfast crew and we made fresh tracks in the snow.  It took us some time at GZ before the cache was found, even with the six of us.  It seems we went a bit too far.  Halestorm came up with it and got the rest pointed in the right direction.</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="False">The posted coordinates will lead you to an area of a former lumber mill.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The final cache is located in an Ontario County park.  Many people from the area are unaware that this place exists.  The land for the park was donated to the county and is an "all natural" park.  As such, it is meant for bird watching, hiking, or fishing along the Canandaigua Outlet.    

Follow the WP2 coords and notice the name of the County Park you are entering, you may've parked at that park's parking lot to get the coords from WP 1. 

***Another mill is located around the corner at the intersection of County Road 25 and McBurney Road. The gypsum mill was once there.  The historical marker in the area used to be part our multi, when it was by County Road 27, a bundle of yards away, but the historical marker has been broken a few times, and now moved, so we removed it from the multi. 

The mystery of the third mill can be found in Phelps by the Main Street Bridge over Flint Creek. A geocache used to be along the guardrails there, and sadly it was archived because it was MIA.  An old grist mill was nearby.  You can still see the remains of the mill from that bridge location.  There is a sign there, that we wanted for the first part, but we couldn't use it at the time because of the geocache guidelines.  

Hopefully, you have enjoyed some local history and you will take the opportunity to see the other mills.

Bug spray is a must in the summer, when searching for the final cache.  Long sleeves and pants are recommended once the brush grows up in the spring.

Happy Hunting,
Pond birds

I was out today &amp; noticed that some maintenance had been performed so I decided it was worth a shot. Spent quite a while looking for WP1; I nearly had my hand on it at one point but then started listening to the GPS which led me away. Finally made the grab and moved on to WP2.

Not sure why I thought this was a 3-stager. With that assumption, I started looking for something smaller than I should have, but then I adjusted my thinking and quickly had the find. Never seen an ammo can quite like this. TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;font size="5"&gt;Eighth in a series of "Quacked-Up!" Rubber
Ducky Holidays!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font size="5"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="#BB0626"&gt;&lt;font face="Comic Sans MS"&gt;&lt;font size=
"4"&gt;&lt;font color="#FF8040"&gt;Well, the ducks and I were sitting around
talking about August and deciding what holiday to celebrate...
since there really isn't an official Holiday in August. So, again
the calendar with the lesser known "holidays"came out and we looked
it over.  One of my little friends seems to be a bit british
because he piped up with "say, aren't you going on HOLIDAY in
August?"  "Well, yes, we are going off to Cape Cod and lazy
days at the beach". Looking over the calendar again we found August
10 to be "Lazy Day" and August 15th to be"Relaxation Day"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
- so there you have it!  It's a Beach Holiday!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By the time I could decide that and turn to talk it over with the
ducks, they were all dressed in their swimsuits and luau gear, had
inner tubes and scuba gear on.. fast little guys and gals!  So
... it is off to the beach we
go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;font color=
"#16AB31"&gt; Cache is a Plastic ammo box filled with Rubber
Duckies that are dressed for beach fun. There are beach
related items, flip flop key chains and bookmarks, also some
uninflated beach balls.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The container is in a park with no hours posted but use your good
judgement on this. It is a very easy walk to within 10 feet of
the cache and then it might be tricky for small children or others
that need an even terrain, you may want them to watch from a short
distance away.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font face="Comic Sans MS" size=
"4"&gt;&lt;font color="#16AB31"&gt;Feel free to grab a duck to take home to
celebrate this special time with you and your family.&lt;br /&gt;
If you don't wish to adopt a duck, please make sure to make a note
of the symbol written on the bottom of the ducks, in the log or on
the laminated picture of the ducks stuck to the lid of the
cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You will need to know the symbol associated with each Quacked-Up!"
Holiday cache in order to find the bonus cache in the
series. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You do not need a trade item to take a duck but:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;font face="Comic Sans MS"&gt;&lt;font color=
"#16AB31"&gt;Please just one duck per person or caching
family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="#FF0000"&gt;&lt;font color="#8000FF"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

trade is just fine.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Travel bugs and coins always welcome! Bring the family, kids will
especially like the holiday caches (and the ducks).&lt;br /&gt;

   <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This cache will bring you a Victor Hiking Trail named Royal View Trail. You must park at the parking coordinates provided. The trail head starts just down the road from where you park. There is a driveway at the trailhead but it's for a town pumping station and is posted for NO PARKING, so please respect the warning.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">We thought this song from Peter Gabriel would be a great name for the title of this cache.  

The half mile hike will start with a wide grassy trail and then narrow to a single file footpath once you get into the woods.  Please be careful and watch your footing.  Follow the Blue trail markers until about 225 ft. from the cache, from then on you will be off the trail.  The cache is up off the ground to be accessible year round.  

You will also pass by two other caches on your way to this cache if you choose to find them. 


PLEASE NOTE:  This cache is not a mystery cache but you will have to figure out how to sign the log.  You won't need any extra tools and should be able to solve the mystery while there.  Once you retrieve and sign the log use the provided item to secure the logbook back in its original location, ready to be found by the next cacher.

This cache holds a logbook but there is no room for swag or trackables.

*PLEASE BE VERY CAREFUL TO NOT ROLL UP THE LOG TOO FAR!
(Confused?...Don't be it will all make sense when your holding it)

**YOU MUST BRING YOUR OWN PEN TO SIGN THE LOG**

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I enjoyed the great walk to this spot, never been back this far and it was worth the hike in.  I tried a little of this and a little of that before eventually doing the right thing and getting me to the prize.

This was a really well-done cache, neat idea and nicely engineered.  A clever cache plus a beautiful spot equals an absolute favorite point.  Thanks for bringing me out to this nice spot and the fun cache.

Tried a number of things, looked for something that may have helped but came up empty.  I had an idea but wasn't sure if I should try it so I called a friend. He confirmed with me not to try my idea.  Sometime afterwards I had the log in hands..

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">An early morning errand got me out of the house before anyone else. After a trip to the other side of the city, thought I'd try sneaking in a few caches before the 'heat' of the day. That was the plan anyway until leaving the house at 6:15AM and already having it 77degrees out!

On my way to the Fairport Ball Fields to do a ring of caches, I remembered there had been a few caches placed toward the end of the Crescent Trail that I hadn't had time to visit. My travels were taking me right by them and there isn't anything like an expected 90+ degree day to hike up and down the hill here!

Decided to take the full walk in and cache my way out. Didn't realize I had more unfound caches here than I thought. Found the trails to be quiet except for one lone runner. Boy, that shows dedication on a day like today!

This was the first stop of 17 tries and 15 finds. Not bad for an oppressive humid day!

Bounced around for a bit before finally spotting the right place to search. Signed in and started the long walk back to the parking lot!</groundspeak:text>

At the moment, as grandparents I think A and I are in between with regard to these jokes. The seven year olds have not quite discovered them yet. (I think, given their temperaments, it will be Ethan rather than Shelby who will regale me with them quite soon). The others have graduated out of the knock knock stage (if that is possible). I'm not much with the jokes--but A can be quite punny--I'll have to get him to make one up. In the meantime--orange you glad that I didn't write up an English lecture here on knock knock jokes in Middle English since I am a retired English instructor?

This Geocache is in the open not hidden under anything. This cache blends in VERY well with it surrounding so you need a VERY good eye. you can say this is real life camo.

Congratulation to tber1981 FTF!! Hope you Enjoyed it. Took me a little bit to make it right.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I came out here with a friend and his daughter today and introduced them to geocaching.

 We started at the top of the hill and had to carefully make our way down to find the cache. Once at the bottom of the hill we began to spread out and search every stump and tree looking for the cache. Then I spotted something that looked a little out of place and there it was.

 We were all happy to make the find and thought the cache container was very cool. It needs a new log book though. Thanks for the cache.</groundspeak:text>

The recent dnf's made me nervous but i gave it a shot since it is this caches hidden b-day.  I found the neat container with little trouble but it was missing the log.  I dropped in a paper I had in my pocket.  Man this hill creeps me out after a friend told me of the satanic rituals he witnessed on this hill in the 80's .  I hurried back to the car.

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">A renewed link to the Crescent trail was cleared in August 2008 by local Boy Scouts for KM's Eagle project. It was overgrown and rarely used until the T208 spent a Saturday with saws and shears to open it up. Not only will hikers appreciate the space but so may the local inhabitants judging from the deer tracks up and down the trail. If you go at dusk, you're bound to see raccoons in the trees.

The trailhead is between 19 Neuchatel Lane and 2 Latour Manor. Walk between four evergreen trees toward large boulder near back of lot on 40' wide strip of town land - please stay on the trail. Look for the blue blazes metal stakes marking the trail. It's an easy walk back to the cache which is located just off the trail. 

The cache is a ammo container; special thanks to slowdownracer for donating the hardware and original contents.  

Please rehide the cache as well as you found it, and as always, Cache In and Trash Out.

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">The cache was placed by a group of young cousins during a family reunion weekend as a group project.  They all believe in the magic of fairies and want to share their enthusiasm with others.  The Middlesex Cemetery seemed like a great location for the cache. Bring butcher paper and crayons for the kids to do some grave rubbings after you locate the cache.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache is a traditional cache in a water-resistant plastic container with camo tape covering it.  It is hidden in a place known to be frequented by fairies and other magical creatures.  Inside the cache are items of significance to fairy lovers.  There are also several artist trading cards and instructions on how to join in on this fun hobby. The cache is hidden at the top of a very steep, but short, hill. The cemetery is built on this hill. Be sure to check out Fairy Cache's companions, Gnome Cache and Unicorn Cache. And coming in September 2013, Mermaid Cache!</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">OH NO! Another hill! After an intense hike to The Spot, we were followed by the neighbors to find out this cache was on private property.  They apparently heard of geocaching, and complained about tresspassers in the past, some of them not geocachers.  The left side of the cemetary is actually private property.  We moved the cache container to the side of the cemetary where the adjacent property owner was comfortable with.  In a 3-trunked oak tree.  Looks like the CO has already updated the co-ordinates before we had a chance to contact the CO!  tftc

Great view from there though.  Funny that we lived about 1/4 mile from this place for years without knowing of the cache.  Kenny found this one for his first find!  Traded some items, signed the log, took some pictures and moved south for another cache.! Thanks</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Greetings!

I noticed that your cache has the needs maintenance attribute set.  This is generally caused when a cacher posts a "needs maintenance log on  your cache for a number of reasons.  If you have addressed the issue or believe there is no issue, you can remove this attribute by posting an "owner maintenance" log, or editing the attribute list to remove it (note on caches other than traditional, the needs maintenance icon does not show, but clicking "Update Attributes" will clear it anyway.)

Often people will filter out caches that require maintenance so making sure this is correct will help cachers find your cache.

If you haven't addressed the issue, go out and find a few caches and fix this one on the way back!  [:)]

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The winter of 2012 - 2013 was long and gray. We (Teamajk, DeltaDelta1 and Yurtles ) coped with the early winter of 2013 by turning our backs on it. Solving puzzle caches was a good way to keep warm and dry and entertained. Cache puzzles posed by sujojeepers and mcdurr in California and Bumble! in Massachusetts were particularly challenging and educational. Each puzzle we solved was based on a different cipher from this American Cryptogram Association list. Click &lt;a target="_ blank" href="http://www.cryptogram.org/cipher_types.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Now we want to share the fun with you by placing some ACA cipher caches in the Finger Lakes area. Good luck and have fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is not at the posted coordinates. You must solve the puzzle to get the cache. There are three one dollar gold coins, one each for the first three finders. Please bring your own pencil or pen.&lt;/p&gt;
Once you find the cipher to use from the list, look at the example which will help you solve the puzzle. The keywords in the example are not the same for this puzzle. You might be able to decrypt the cipher text before you get the keywords. Also the period may be different.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many times that we sometimes are too busy to notice some things whether they are big or small so,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Another great cipher puzzle from DeltaDelta1!  Learned how to do this cipher and had a lot of fun with it.  Had to get a few nudges from the CO went through a bit of scrap paper and then got it solved.  Another beautiful sunny day to go for a walk to grab it.  Thanks for the great puzzle, help and very nice hide.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We combined caching, a visit to Linda's mom and checking hiking boots at Beans and EMS in the Victor/Fairport areas. Locating this cache came first. We solved for the coords soon after it came out, but it is a very meaty/chewy (read hard) puzzle that took time, in spite of being a little familiar with the cipher. Paper and pencil came through, got us the coords and today we found the puzzle. All is well with this nicely hidden cache, TN, left a geocaching round tuit button and signed the log. Thanks for the fun in a park we had not been to until now, yurtles.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was another wild ride that DeltaDelta1 took us on. I solved this shortly after it came out but never had time to go grab it.

The puzzle was once again challenging and really made me work to get an answer. Thee 'old school' puzzles can get frustrating at times but they are also fun. It's nice to get away from programs and just use the mind (although while doing it I wish I had a program to do it!).

Of all of the series this has been my favorite spot for a final. I would have never known about this particular area and my wife even joined me for this one.

We got to GZ and I slowed down about 30 ft away. My wife pointed and said 'I would put it over there'. I thought the same thing and apparently so did the CO because I was soon signing the log book.

Thanks for a nice walk in a mild rain and a great place to visit. THis one gets a favorite point.

The time and effort you put into these puzzles shows in the quality of the puzzles and the brain cells I have burned out in doing them!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">JFW26 and I have been working (struggling) with DeltaDelta1's puzzles since he released his first puzzle back in 2010. We may not be first to solve or first to find, however we (mostly jfw) eventually work our way to solving the puzzle, finding the cache and signing the log. This was our second stop on an epic DeltaDelta sign the log day. Thanks for the fun!</groundspeak:text>

Pulled out my pencil and paper and got to work.  On the one hand, I'm sorry this one wasn't out last weekend so I could find it while I was up there, but on the other hand, it gives me something to look forward to for the next trip!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Co FTF with Spooko13 at about 7:03 PM.
 Took a look at this at lunch today and using a tool made some easy progress as I learned about this cipher.  Quickly deciphered but it took longer to get the keys.  This is an interesting cipher in that it is related to a well known cipher.  It should be straightforward to build an automated cracker for this. I learned a lot with this cipher and for that I am giving a favorite.  On the way home from work saw that it still had not been found.  Convinced my daughter to go with me (although she stayed in the car).  I starting walking to the cache when who pulls up in another nearby parking lot but spooko13.  Hustled over to GZ where a few moments later spooko13 shows up and we look through the large area of cover.  After a little searching we came up with the cache.  Got to chat a little on the way back to the car but had to take off too soon to get my daughter to Hanks.  TFTC and cipher SL</groundspeak:text>

Second, as I approached, about a million--ok maybe a couple less than that--house sparrows flew out of the bushes and scared the life outta me!  Then, an ornery little bunch landed on Olive the Geomobile and "had their way with it" for payback.  So if you saw a crazy lady screaming and flailing by the bushes, then chasing sparrows off a now-poop-covered jeep, that was me.  I don't care what folks say about cache&amp;dash...for me it's ALWAYS an adventure!!!  TFTH!</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">I hope your bikes are in working order, because that is the intended mode of transportation for this series. Between Palmyra and Newark there are 12 colored bison tubes placed along the Erie Canal Trail. Each cache will count as a separate smiley, so be sure to sign each log. On six of the bison tubes there is a metal tag with a letter and a number. Make note of this information, as it will be needed to find the final in the series: “Erie Canalside Bike Ride: Grand Finale”  [http://coord.info/GC3KFEX] . The caches containing this information will not be designated on the cache pages, so you must find all 12 micros to get the final. Please do not mention anything about getting needed information in your logs, or they will be deleted. Not knowing which caches have final coord information is part of the fun (for me anyway)! The series is about 17 miles round trip, assuming you start at the posted parking coordinates. The terrain rating on the caches will get higher the further they are from the parking coordinates, because this series is meant to be done in one trip. Happy pedaling!

Please replace this exactly as you found it. There is a special item there to keep it in place. Please use it.

This is now a cammoed bison tube.

But now that we have gotten to know him better, we have learned
different. He has a great sense of humor, that innocent "who me?"
look, quick one liners that keep us in stitches, and an unmatchable
honesty about him.&lt;br /&gt;

BT had already logged this cache so I was on my own for the hunt.  Spotted something "suspicious" when I got to GZ and was quickly pulling the nicely painted ammo can out of its hiding spot.  Signed in, grabbed the geocoin and we were on our way.

Nice area.  If it weren't for the muggles that appeared just as I arrived, I would not have found it so quickly.  I diverted from where I thought GZ was to try and look nonchalant, and then spotted it right away.  I do wonder of someone moved it as it's a bit off.  The old log smells like a cigarette (I see someone's log mentioned there was a cigarette butt in it awhile back...yuk! Some people!)

I mean it! I promise!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">A bitter sweet moment...I finally have this one but the saga is over. I now have all of Tilley's caches.  It has been a great time doing all of your caches. I have loved the spots, the creativity and the fun.  

On another note, the saga isn't really over since I have something else to do while in here...</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">An early morning errand got me out of the house before anyone else. After a trip to the other side of the city, thought I'd try sneaking in a few caches before the 'heat' of the day. That was the plan anyway until leaving the house at 6:15AM and already having it 77degrees out!

On my way to the Fairport Ball Fields to do a ring of caches, I remembered there had been a few caches placed toward the end of the Crescent Trail that I hadn't had time to visit. My travels were taking me right by them and there isn't anything like an expected 90+ degree day to hike up and down the hill here!

Decided to take the full walk in and cache my way out. Didn't realize I had more unfound caches here than I thought. Found the trails to be quiet except for one lone runner. Boy, that shows dedication on a day like today!

This was the second stop of 17 tries and 15 finds. Not bad for an oppressive humid day!

Started on the wrong side with my search but soon found myself in the right general area. Ringed my favorite choice and still came up empty. As I was preparing to pull up the cache description and looking down, there was the cache! It looked pretty lonely on the ground. Signed in and placed it where it appeared to have fallen from.

Thanks for the nice walk!</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is located on the secluded and little known Royal
View Trail in Fishers, NY near the north end of Fishers Road.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Here's how to locate the trailhead:&lt;/b&gt; If you zoom-in fairly
close on either the MapPoint or Geocaching maps, you'll see the
little roads I reference below. Parking Coordinates: N 43 01.893 /
W 077 28.068&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Near the north end of Fishers Road turn on to Royal View. It's
a small housing track. There's a regular street sign for it as well
as a big fancy wood and brick sign. Royal View is on Fishers Road
between Whistle Stop and where the big power lines cross Fishers
Road.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drive to the top of the hill and bear left on to Royal Woods.
Drive to the end and park in the little turn-around area on the
left -- there's room for two cars.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go through the pine trees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look to your right to where the trees (not the pine trees, the
other trees) start and down the slope along the tree line about
40-60 feet. There should be two pieces of orange flagging tape.
That's the trailhead -- &lt;b&gt;be careful, the slope down to the
trailhead is short but steep!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you're in the trees you'll see blue Victor Hiking Trails
markers on the trees and blue rectangle blazes painted on the
trees. Just follow them along to keep on the trail. &lt;b&gt;No
bushwhacking necessary!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be careful as the trail taverses the side face of the hill if
it's wet or snowy -- it'd be a long tumble to the bottom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please do not park on Benson Road and bushwhack straight up the
hill -- you will be trespassing on private property if you do
so.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be sure to enjoy the view while you're up there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victor Hiking Trails is working on getting permission to extend
the trail so it starts out on Fishers Road at the water
department's pumping sub-station. When they do that I will update
this cache page accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache's name comes from the fact that it started out life
stocked with things that are used to contain other things -- boxes,
pouches, bowls, etc. Feel free to trade whatever sort of items you
like. I'll reload a few theme items whenever I do maintenance on
the cache. Signature items and travel bugs are always welcome, of
course!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache container is a .30 caliber ammunition box.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I am sorry to say that I had to archive the cache GOOD OL’
BLUE,&lt;br /&gt;
because the container was unfixable. I had gathered up all of
the&lt;br /&gt;
keys I used with Ol’ Blue and had them with me when I went out
to&lt;br /&gt;
see her this last time MAY SHE REST IN PEACE or should I say&lt;br /&gt;
pieces. A funny thing happened while I was poking around looking
for&lt;br /&gt;
any more loose keys……….. Ol’ Blue’s ghost muggled me. She
knocked&lt;br /&gt;
me down, took the container I had the keys in and scared me half
to&lt;br /&gt;
death. I took off running for the car only to see the ghost
throw&lt;br /&gt;
the container about 100 feet from her resting place. As it landed
I&lt;br /&gt;
heard the keys bounce in every direction. Being a remorseful
ghost&lt;br /&gt;

gathering&lt;br /&gt;
up all of the keys.&lt;br /&gt;

Good OL’ BLUE was a great gal, but she was very dyslexic and I
am&lt;br /&gt;
sure she had a hard time putting them back in any sort of
order.&lt;br /&gt;
She may have followed me from the last spot I was in prior to&lt;br /&gt;
looking in on her and if she did she may have left a clue to
where&lt;br /&gt;
I put a recycled ammo can with a Log Book in it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If someone can decipher her clue there is a FTF prize of 8 US
State&lt;br /&gt;
Quarters (all minted at the Denver Mint) for them to claim.
Feel&lt;br /&gt;
free to trade any of these states for the ones I left as
SWAG.&lt;br /&gt;
There is a bit more SWAG and a few foreign coins in there as&lt;br /&gt;
well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This has been a long time coming for me.  I had tried for this one shortly after I started caching a couple of years ago.  I was pretty new to the game and was still learning the ropes so to speak.  Basically, this was too tough for a newbie like me!

BrotherTim and I had been talking about looking for this one for a while now, but we never seemed to come up with a good time for the hunt.  With the latest find date coming up on it's one year anniversary, I started thinking more about it lately.  We planned on visiting the hide tonight barring a major thunderstorm washing us out.

The weather held and shortly after the work day ended we were heading for the first WP.  During the past couple of years since my first, unsuccessful visit, I had built this one up in my head as the world's most difficult hide...a mountain of difficulty so insurmountable not even the CO himself could find it.  (The impression this must have made on a poor newbie!)  Well, under normal circumstances I'm sure this IS difficult (there are some DNFs that would back up that thought), but tonight turned out to be anything but.  As we walked closer to GZ, BT spotted the first WP lying right out in the open.  A bit anticlimactic to be sure, but I was still psyched nonetheless.  (It was too hot and humid for an hour long search, anyway!)  We started working on the field puzzle, and after a brief trip down the wrong path the coords presented themselves.  Excellent!  We hid the WP as we expected it should have been hidden and ventured off to the final.  The rest, as they say, is history.

Thank you for the very enjoyable and creative puzzle!  I had fun with this one and am glad BT was able to join me for the final chapter in my "Good Ol' Blue 2" story.  I'm happy (and a bit relieved) to have it moved into the found column!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Spooko13 and I have been looking at doing this cache for a long time. With a thunderstorm approaching tonight we decided it would be perfect.  

The night went something like this....

As we moved to WP1 I wondered why I didn't 'swat' grab this one 'swat' when I was in the area 'swat' cleaning out all the other 'swat' caches. I had been here 'swat' and grabbed all the 'swat' other 'swat' caches that are 'swat' here.  Oh well 'swat' I must have 'swat' ignored it because 'swat' 'swat' it was a 'swat' puzzle.

My GOS showed 15 ft, Spooko's showed 235 ft.  I looked down and said 'swat'  there it is!

We started doing what we needed to do and realized that we had forgotten something almost as important as our GPS...bug spray.  After awhile you can't tell the bites form the bites you are imagining you are being bitten with.

So swatting away we made our way to GZ and found what we had been dreaming about for so long.  The sweet joy of a cache that we wanted that was also a year lonely today!


We happily swatted our way out and then I found I had bug spray that I had left in the car....doh!

Thanks for a very clever cache, we really had a great time. We also fed a lot of mosquito's between the two of us.


The one thing we forgot - bug spray!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">YEAH!!!
Armed with a hint from the CO UCCSteach and I made our way yet again to find WP1...she for the third time, me for the fourth time.  We spent some time searching but then I finally made the find!  

Now onto solve what we had in hand.  There are two possible ways to approach this.  Having taken the wrong way first (though not even realizing at the time there was a second way), reverse thinking netted us the final coords.

A pleasant walk to the final confirmed a 20 point lonely cache (last found 9/23/10).  Hopefully more folks will visit this now.  Enjoyed the in-field puzzle solving!  TFTC!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Greetings!

I noticed that your cache has the needs maintenance attribute set.  This is generally caused when a cacher posts a "needs maintenance log on  your cache for a number of reasons.  If you have addressed the issue or believe there is no issue, you can remove this attribute by posting an "owner maintenance" log, or editing the attribute list to remove it (note on caches other than traditional, the needs maintenance icon does not show, but clicking "Update Attributes" will clear it anyway.)

Often people will filter out caches that require maintenance so making sure this is correct will help cachers find your cache.

I love it so much that one of the first caches I attempted to find was Captain Jon's Prospect Hill Cache right in this very park. I failed miserably on my first attempt, but was able to redeem myself after I was a little more experienced.  Jon graciously archived his cache so that I could place Dakboy's Golden Ammo Can here. Now I am placing a thank you cache for allowing me to bring more people to this hidden gem.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">There are two parking areas. Both will lead to a fairly steep climb up a gravel road and into the park. There may be some prickers around the cache site. Mosquitos are terrible here, as is the the GPS reception. Your geosense will be useful here. Please replace the cache as you found it. I hope you enjoy the area as much as I do.

 We started at the bottom of the hill off of johnson st. and walked up the stone road looking for geocaches on our way to Dak boys golden Lock n Lock. I'm not sure which girl found the box, but they were both very happy to make the find as Al and I were still making our way up the hill. The girls made a few trades and I signed the log book.

It is amazing how many of them are the same as the streets around Honeoye.  A practical who's who of honeoye's founding families.

The cache is not around the headstones. Please be respectful of the location.  This is a daylight only cache.

After we walked back to the car, we thought to look at the hint, and decided to talk another stab at it. It was a cemetery cache, for heaven's sake. I'm pretty sure that we have no DNFs for cemetery caches. So back again, and estral made the find. Great little container, great hide. Lots of Ashleys in this cemetery!

On vacation in the Honeoye Lake region (rented a cottage) and decided to go out and explore the area w/ Mrs. Digger.

This one took us a few minutes to locate.  Rains were fast approaching as we SL and skeedaddled. Rain got to us anyway, but it was a nice warm summer rain so I didn't mind. Beautiful cemetery.

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This another of our very easy walks. Please remember that the land
on either side of the trail is private and is hunted during the
season. The cache is just off the trail on the old Lehigh Valley
right of way. No need to go onto private land. We found this sight
when we were looking for a place for our first cache. It was not
suitable for that cache, but we conjured up one that would work
here. It is a small camo taped rubbermaid snack box little leager
would have in the dug out. The cache name is not a joke. You could
easily watch your little one bat, find the cache, and be back
before they are up again. Please remember to read the signs, walk
on the right side of the trail or wipe your feet well before you
get back into your car. The best parking is at N42 59.794 / W077
30.583 both for the cache and the ball game. There are a few small
items that may come in handy at the game or on your walk. There is
room for a small TB or two. "Haaay Badder, Badder."</groundspeak:long_description>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">This cache is placed as an homage to my geobuddy MacCrew's love of Indian Hill.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">It has been my pleasure to have found many hundreds of caches with MacCrew over the last few years.  She has placed many enjoyable caches of her own as well. She serves as the official photographer for Durf's Regulars, is an excellent puzzle solver, and always makes sure we are well stocked with peanut butter pretzels for our Sunday excursions (for which I thank her but my waistline doesn't.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While she is well known in the Rochester geocaching community, perhaps it is less well know how much she loves Indian Hill. She never misses a chance to scramble up the hill to snag a cache.  Mud and ice on the trail? No problem for her!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I noticed that she hasn't been up Indian Hill for almost 24 hours now, so I thought I'd give her another opportunity to explore her passion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First to find hounds, beware! I haven't given MacCrew any advance knowledge about this cache, but I'm sure her boots are already laced up.&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">An early morning errand got me out of the house before anyone else. After a trip to the other side of the city, thought I'd try sneaking in a few caches before the 'heat' of the day. That was the plan anyway until leaving the house at 6:15AM and already having it 77degrees out!

On my way to the Fairport Ball Fields to do a ring of caches, I remembered there had been a few caches placed toward the end of the Crescent Trail that I hadn't had time to visit. My travels were taking me right by them and there isn't anything like an expected 90+ degree day to hike up and down the hill here!

Decided to take the full walk in and cache my way out. Didn't realize I had more unfound caches here than I thought. Found the trails to be quiet except for one lone runner. Boy, that shows dedication on a day like today!

This was the third stop of 17 tries and 15 finds. Not bad for an oppressive humid day!

Was heading to one area when what appeared to be a geo-pile led me to the wrong side of the trail for a moment. When that didn't pan out, headed to where I'd expected to go. Found that much more promising. Spotted the familiar-looking container and signed in.

Thanks for the nice hike!</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Our dog Tippy was adopted from Lollypop Farm 15 years ago (1994). She was a great dog who loved to go on walks and be with the family. This past spring we had to say goodbye to her at the age of 16 1/2 and she is laid to rest at Lollypop too. So we thought it fitting to place a cache in her honor. 

Check out the petting farm and other available animals at the shelter. Who knows, you may go home with a new caching buddy.

The cache is a small lock 'n lock starting with new toys for small dogs, cats, and ferrets, a log book, pencil, and a doxietrekkers ride TB. We ask that should you choose to trade to do with quality pet toys (ie. no shredded shoes, socks, stuffed animals.) You could always just donate the toy to the shelter too.

They are only warning you to stay away from the edge of the canal.  The spillway can be treacherous to those who aren't careful.  So be careful.


Update:  A few folks have made mention of poison ivy.  Im pretty reactive to the stuff my self, so this is probably bad for my karma.  I placed the cache in the winter months when there was little or no foliage.  Apparently this place fills in quite densely during summer, so pleas be cautious.</groundspeak:long_description>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="False">Congratulations to Captain Jon on finding 1000 caches!</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This relatively simple multi-cache will take you on a short trip through Jon's caching history.  The first waypoint will bring you to the park where he found his very first cache (Trolls Hole.  GCMF8K), while the final will bring you to an area that Jon calls home these days.  

Both stages are simple, easy finds, themed around the Captains OTHER hobby (who has time for TWO hobbies, anyway?).  Not entirely certain that either waypoint would be classified as wheelchair accessible, but they're really close.  There are two stages to this multi, the only catch is that there is a distance of several miles between them.  

If you see anyone sitting outside, very nearby the final, wave your gps at them, and introduce yourself.  They will be very well aware of what you are up to.  Final is hidden on private property with permission.

I loved stage 1, although I had trouble with one of the digits.  I was pushing the limits at stage 2, but I knew that the landowner was busy at a different location, and that it would be OK to make the quick grab.  Congrats to Captain Jon on the first few thousand. . . may the next few be just as much fun or more so!  Thanks for the cache, Boots. . . . loved the extra decor, too.</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">     There is a lot of history in Aqueduct Park. The aqueduct was built in 1857 on the original Erie Canal to carry water over Mud Creek. The 144-year-old Aldrich Change Bridge is now fully restored. A change bridge allowed mules towing barges to reverse directions without having to be unhitched and transported across the canal. The 74-foot-long, 14-foot-wide bridge was built in 1858 and originally sat over the canal in Rochester. It is the oldest surviving cast iron bridge in the state, and the only surviving canal change bridge. The restored bridge spans the original Erie Canal bed which is over 175 years old.
     
     The cache is a well-hidden 30 cal. ammo can, painted camouflage. Inside are the logbook and an assortment of goodies. Please be sure to re-hide the cache well so the next person can enjoy the hunt.
     
     The section of the park where the cache is hidden includes original segments of the Erie Canal. There is also marshland teeming with wildlife like mallards, heron, blue jays, and turtles.  There are a couple of different trails leading to the cache location so choose wisely.The trail(s) start out easy, but the last 100 feet to the cache may be tricky. 
Enjoy your adventure!</groundspeak:long_description>

Despite it being pretty dry lately that hill is still a deceivingly slippery slope; I have the muddy arse to prove it, but at least I didn't lose a shoe.  Thanks for bringing me to a new park--saw some local wildlife attempting to launch their boat in the laziest way possible, a great blue heron flew out into the water, and a ton of frogs "blooped" into the water near the cache.  Cache was not really hidden and bag is taking up most of the space, but in good shape and hidden a little better now.  Thanks for bringing me out here!</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This cache will bring you a Victor Hiking Trail named Royal View Trail. You must park at the parking coordinates provided. The trail head starts just down the road from where you park. There is a driveway at the trailhead but it's for a town pumping station and is posted for NO PARKING, so please respect the warning.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">We recently just saw the band Wilco when they came to Rochester at the Highland Bowl on 8-3-12.  It was an amazing show and thought we should name our cache after this song. 

The trail begins with a grassy wide path and changes to a small single file footpath as you get into the woods.  Please watch your footing.  You are looking for a small Lock-n-Lock container that has a logbook, pens/pencils, swag, and room for trackables.


Congrats on the FTF go to:  Turbodog41

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I came out this morning and was looking forward to a return trip to this area, I was back here a couple years ago for previous caches.  

It's too bad the town doesn't keep this trail maintained, the first part of the walk in the field, the weeds were shoulder height, a recipe for picking up tics.  So I did a lot of brushing and shaking and wiggling and it seems I kept them away.  

I got fixated on one spot that the GPS took me to originally.  My GPS has been overshooting lately and then bouncing back, so once I eventually bounced back to the new spot it wanted me I was able to find the well hidden cache.

Thanks for bringing me out to the trails!

Good Luck - and don’t shoot your eye out!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Spent  quite some time working on this and had to do some extra research to make everything come out right. Did make some errors but finally got the right solution. Made my way to the GZ and I remember doing another cache in here so the terrain is rated good for the hike here. Found the cache partly exposed but everything is intact. It has been a while since someone has found this. Signed the logbook and place the container back where I found it with just a little more natural cammo on it.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I've never actually seen this movie, so this cache has been grating on my nerves for quite a while. Every now and then I'd take a look at it, maybe take a hack at a couple of the clues, but left it at that. It just sat there, unsolved. Last weekend, I made a serious effort with the all-knowing Google and got all but one of my answers. That last one came with a visit to the posted coords while I was out running errands. I had my coords, they looked right, but not knowing the movie I felt pangs of self-doubt.

Decided that I needed to take a hike this morning to get the blood flowing and this was a good spot. After striking out on another cache, I doubled back on the trail &amp; came this way. Once my GPS started showing that I was moving away, I decided to take an off-trail direct route, not knowing how far the trail would take me before coming back in the right direction. Really should have saved the URL for that trail map I found last night. I eventually found myself near GZ with a lot of places to search, but fortunately a compressed area due to the property line. Search only took a couple minutes as the cache wasn't well-concealed. I dropped off a coin, then tucked everything away.

The walk out was longer than I expected (I continued down the trail, instead of retracing my steps), and dropped me in a place I wasn't expecting either. No big deal though, just little extra walking time to enjoy in the cool, still morning air. Feet got a little wet in the grass - I guess it really is time to retire these old boots. Glad to have this one finished off. TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was quite an adventure for us. N3 and I came here two years ago to look for this but were missing one number of the coords, so we walked in a line using 0-9 for that number and looking in any likely spot, but weren't able to come up with it.  Yesterday I resolved the puzzle all over again, and realized the number we were missing referred to the item at the posted coords - duh.  N2 and I came by here today and I realized I either re-solved the puzzle wrong or keyed the wrong numbers into the GPS.  Tried replacing some things here and there but nothing worked, so I tried to find the general location we ended our search last time, and using a mishmash of the coords there, the keyed numbers from the "re-solve", plus the missing answer from the posted coords, and came up with a reasonable spot to look.  We headed over there and wouldn't you know - there it was.  Thanks for the fun!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Just adopted a dog from Lollypop about 2 months. Took her (Piper) and the one we had (Uma) and they had a grand old time romping in the woods. Bit of a hike, but loved it. Nice puzzle and I learned something. People talk about this Christmas classic, but I never recall watching it. Grinch, Charlie Brown, Rudolf, Santa Claus is coming to town, It's a wonderful life, Miracle on 34th st., those I remember. One of the questions is what year the movie came out- well it was the year I graduated high school! No wonder I don't remember it. TFTC.
Oh, evince or similar coordinate verifier would be nice.</groundspeak:text>

Well I got to GZ and found nothing. After a very long search, still nothing. I called a friend and what he described was nowhere in the area. 

Then he mentioned the log form the PinkPanthers. Sure enough, 100+ feet away I found the cache at N43.04.434 and W077.18.369

I loved the hide at this one, you may want to update the cords on the page.   This one gets a favorite for the way this is hidden, I really enjoyed it.

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The first leg of this 2-stage is located on the Canal Trail in the Village of Palmyra.  Please use discretion as you search for the cache, as there are residences and businesses within view.  Replace EXACTLY as found.  
The final will bring you to an area given to the Township of Palmyra by founder General John Swift.  This land was the site for both the first church and first schoolhouse in Palmyra.  Most of the pioneers linked to the founding and settling of Palmyra are buried here.  Oh, rumor has it that this area is haunted, so venture in the dark at your own risk!

6/29/11 update:  I had to replace the container at the final as it was missing.  Please replace it using the surrounding material as cover.</groundspeak:long_description>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I have been wanting to get out here and place this cache for a long time. Between work and getting sick I didn't make it, until today . I feel like I moved at a snails pace getting this in. It took me an hour to hike to the spot, but I took my time. The cache is breakable so please be careful and make sure it is hidden well. No need to cross into private property. There were no signs in this area. Looks like it's my turn to send everyone back up Indian Hill...</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">FTF!  Well, after I ripped S4C's name out of the log.

When I got to parking I saw the S4Cmobile, as I fully expected I would.  He leaves work earlier than I do.  Barkley and I had a nice hike up the hill, probably for the 100th time in the last couple years or so.  I hadn't run into S4C yet so I figured he was still at GZ searching, but alas he wasn't.  He probably took the blue trail back and I think I was on the yellow/orange trail.

Half way up Barkley insisted on a swim in the pond, but I expected that as he always swims here.

It's always hard to search for micros with Barkley, so I asked S4C via text if he was still here.  Seems I text'd his home line, or somebody's line, as I didn't have his cell number.  Shortly after he was at parking as saw my car and sent me a note.   I got a hint from him which helped me sign in after him.  While I always enjoy a hike up here, I'd rather not *have* to hike back here to undo a DNF!

Another stop on the way back for a quick swim, and we were back at parking.

Barkley was stinky before we hiked, and was stinkier after the hike, so he "enjoyed" a nice bath when we got home.

Thanks for the hide!  Team Chilehead enjoyed the walk.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I saw this cache early this morning and figured it wouldn't last until I had the chance to find it.  So I went to work, then did errands and went home to see that it still had no logs.  So I decided to go for a walk.  I remember when I did my first cache on Indian hill, I thought it was a ridiculous hike.  Now it's no big deal to run up there for a FTF.  No geo-mobiles in the parking area, I made it up the hill a to GZ no problem, FTF at 4:45.  I seem to recall another cache right near here.  I had an idea of how this would be hidden, and I was only part right.  Found the cache with no troubles.  Back at parking, I saw the Chilemobile, not sure how I missed him on the trail.  And really surprised to see a DNF from the Tilley Hat.  Thanks for the cache, gotta love Indian Hill!</groundspeak:text>

His memory was a bit fuzzy but he did mention one thing that he was pretty sure of.  That one thing turned out to be the golden ticket, though, as I eventually ended up with cache in hand.

I came to this part of the trail today to finish some multis from last month and make my way east. I got to the parking lot for this and another multi close by. I decided to go for the other multi first. I searched and searched for 90minutes, refusing to give up. My thoughts going through my head are not fit for print.  When I couldnt take it any longer I came for this one. When I got to close, my GPS was taking me away from where the hint was telling me. My thoughts became audible grumbles aimed at the CO. After a breif search, i conceided to my GPS and it took me right to the final of the multi!! Wait a minute. . . &amp;$%@!!!! 
     I confused the waypoints and was looking for the complete wrong thing. I am the worst. Upon arrival for the second time, I was able to make the find with out even leaving the seat of my bike and off I was to the final. 
    Captain Jon, If you felt your ears ringing today for about 2 hours, now you know why and I take it all back! These were a couple of fun caches and both are in fine shape. TFTC</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I solved this one a long time ago, but never made it out here to do it.  Today, as we neared the location, I noticed that we were too close to pass it up.  We wandered around a bit before coming up with most of wp1.  One number was not legible, so we made a guess, but that turned out wrong.  A call to the CO, and he gave us an idea of how far to head, so we altered our coords by one digit, and we were soon in the right location.  Tanders spotted something interesting, and soon we found the cache.  MacCrew and I made the retrieval.
We fixed the wp1 coords, so everything is good to go.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This is great. A puzzle I can solve! Being so far from home, I never solved this puzzle but since I was out with friends today who had the final coordinates, I figured I'd better brush up on my nautical flags. The first waypoint was tricky and we made some educated guesses with the help of Pep using phone a friend to confirm our coordinates. From there, made our way to the final where I spotted something out of the ordinary. Enjoyed watching the dynamic duo of Hale and MacCrew as they released the cache from its prison. Unfortunately, it started to rain after finding this cache but luckily it didn't last long. Thanks for the fun and interesting cache!</groundspeak:text>

(I will point out that I did solve this a very long time ago but had never come to get it and didn't have the corrected coords in my GPS.) Had some trouble at wp1 with the coords not being readable. Pep called the CO, who wasn't home, but was able to help us enough to get us where we needed to go. Found the well-hidden final after slogging through some pretty thick mud along the trail. Took a bit to retrieve it, as it was stuck, but a bit of teamwork by Hale and me got it freed. Signed the log and went back to fix the issues at wp1. TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Not sure why I never found this one. I have had it solved for years. I guess I don't get out this way much.  Now I need to find it for the Favorite challenge. Grabbed the 1st wpt with little trouble on the way home from work.  The Final gave me fits.  For a cache thats been around for a while there was little or no geotrails for clues. It took me a while to even get in the right area.  Missed it by inches on the first pass than finally spotted it.  Sneaky.  TFTH JON!!!</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Hope you have FUN and even enjoy learning more about our printed
currency. Maybe you never even gave a second thought to the bill(s)
you were spending, but after this cache you just might!!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">During the decade of the 1990's the US Government experimented with
the printing process for the "ONE DOLLAR BILL". They tried to print
them on a continuous web printing press and not on the single plate
type of equipment which had (and has) been used for years. Even
though Millions of bills were printed during this experiment it was
a total FLOP and the equipment was sold for PENNIES on the DOLLAR.
Isn't it just like our government to waste our money trying to
print more money?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You will need to do some internet research to complete this
cache.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
There are many "codes” printed on our cash and you will need to
break some of them to get to this cache.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
First of all we will only be dealing with Federal Reserve Notes.
There are a number of Federal Reserve Banks and they are associated
with cities all across the US.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
First Question - How many Federal Reserve Cities are there?
Q1=?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Question two - There are 102 letters total in all of the names of
these cities. Count the frequency that each letter shows up in all
of the names ( i.e. Mississippi the count would be M=1, I=4, P=2,
S=4). The answers you get will be Q2A to Q2Z.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Since we are looking only at "Small" size Federal Reserve One
Dollar Notes the following are the possible "series" for these
bills (as of the printing of this cache page): 1963, 1963A, 1963B,
1969, 1969A, 1969B, 1969C, 1969D, 1974, 1977, 1977A, 1981, 1981A,
1985, 1988, 1988A, 1993, 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2003A, 2006.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The series on a bill is like a date on a coin, but be careful a
bill like series 1974 may have been printed in 1974, 1975 or even
1976. Also watch out for the trailing letters in some series as in
1963A or 1963B. There are two signatures on each bill and one or
the other or maybe even both will change with the series.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Question three - How many different signature names are there in
the three series that the Web Notes were released in? Q3=?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Question four - In the spelling of all the signature names how many
"L"s are there used (LAST NAMES ONLY!!!)? Q4=?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Question five - In all the signature names how many start with "B"s
(LAST NAMES ONLY!!!)? Q5=?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
On “normal” dollar bills there are “Plate Positions” codes printed
(front left side). These tell us the where on the master sheet this
bill was located during the printing process.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
There are none of these number/letter combinations on Web Notes
because there is no “plate” to have a position on. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Question six – If you assign a number 1 to whatever to the letters
in this code ( like A=1, B=2……… etc.) what number do you get when
you subtract the largest number in this “Plate Position Code” from
the number represented by the “biggest” letter. Q6=?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
There is another code on the front (to the right) of the bill and
it is the “Plate Number”. This number has the “Plate Position Code”
letter and a sequentially growing number for bills printed by the
Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) in Washington DC. There now
is another location where bills are printed also. This location
puts two “extra” letters on a bills “Plate Number Code”. These
‘extra” letters will never show up on Web Notes because they all
were printed in Washington DC. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Question seven – If you again assign numbers to the letters as in
question six what is the total of these two “extra” letters?
Q7=?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
There is a "Plate Number" for the back of the bill too. "Normally"
this is positioned low to the right in the "open area" and are
sequentially increasing as the series is printed. With the Web
Notes this number's position is moved and it is near, just above, a
LARGE LETTER on the back of the bill. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Question eight - If you again represent the letters as numbers as
in question six what is the "number value" for the letter the
"Plate Number" designation is just above. Q8=?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
SO MUCH FOR THE EASY STUFF............... &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
During the "third Printing Step". the COPE process, the bills get
the Federal Reserve Shield with Letters, the Treasury Seal, and the
Serial Numbers put on the bill. This makes each one of the bills
unique. In the Serial Number there are letters and numbers. The
letter combinations make up what are called "Blocks" and the at the
time of the Web Note printings there were "Runs" of serial
numbering to get from 00000001 to 96000000. There are tables
available to tell you when each Block and Run were printed (only
month and year).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Question nine - How many "Blocks" are there within the three series
of Experimental Web Notes? Q9=?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Question ten - How many "Block/ Run" combinations are there with
this experimental series of bills? Q10=?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
There are hundreds of "Block/Run/Plate" Combination notes examples
out there, but that is too many for us to look at and work with
here. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
MORE ADVANCED STUFF....... &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
When a bill (or more exactly a sheet of bills) is messed up in the
printing process a replacement is substituted in the package to
keep the serialized bills in proper order. Not only does this keep
this package of bill in order, but all after it. The note (sheet of
notes) is known as a replacement note there is a "star" substituted
for the last letter (in the case we are dealing with) in the serial
number and therefore making way for another slang name for these
notes........ a "STAR" note.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Question eleven - What is the Federal Reserve Letter (changed to a
number) for the only "Star" bill in any of the three Web Note
series? Q11=?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
FINALLY one HARD one............ &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Question twelve - If the months are represented as numbers (Jan=1,
Feb=2, March=3........etc.) what month did the WEB NOTEs with Block
DC in Run 11 get printed? Q12=?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Some of these bills are still in circulation. I have found three of
these “Web Note” bills within the past two years from bills
circulating right here in Fairport. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The FTF prize is either a "WEB NOTE" or a nice new crisp $5 bill.
It will be the FTF finder's choice. Neither will be in the cache,
but I will make arrangements to get whichever bill the finder wants
to them. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Again I hope you have FUN with this cache. It is meant to be a
small bit of education as well as a standard "HAVE FUN" cache. &lt;br&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Greetings!

I noticed that your cache has the needs maintenance attribute set.  This is generally caused when a cacher posts a "needs maintenance log on  your cache for a number of reasons.  If you have addressed the issue or believe there is no issue, you can remove this attribute by posting an "owner maintenance" log, or editing the attribute list to remove it (note on caches other than traditional, the needs maintenance icon does not show, but clicking "Update Attributes" will clear it anyway.)

Often people will filter out caches that require maintenance so making sure this is correct will help cachers find your cache.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This took a long time to solve, a very involved puzzle.  I know more about money than I ever thought possible!

So after solving it I ended up never going for it.  I have had the cords for months.  I am off today so I decided to make a couple stops for a couple caches I have been wanting to find.

This was stop one. My wife came along and we enjoyed a nice bike ride. Spotted what looked like a weasel near the final.

Took a minute for me to choose my way to the cache but I made it to GZ and found what I was looking for.  The log was damp but I was able to sign in.

Thanks for the challenge, this was a very tough puzzle to solve and it feels great to have it finally solved and found.  The amount of work this took to put together is amazing.  Hope some more folks give it a try.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">After a nice hike with Tilley, S4C and girls we were able to make the find. We donated a lot to the local skeeters as they had word of our arrival and it was open season on cachers.

The puzzle ended up being a cumulative effort spread out over a really long time.  We thought we might never have it but after another review as it creeped higher on our close to home list - the missing piece was found and we quickly notified S4C and TTH that we had the go from evince.  We are so glad to have this off our list. Thanks for the in-depth knowledge and the cache!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I have no idea where to start.  I've been looking at this puzzle literally for years.  I know what a web note is and have 24 of them in my collection, but that didn't help me.  I did the research, two or three times, but still couldn't get an evince.  Tried collaborating with the PPs a while back, but they were too busy to crack it.  Too frustrated to continue, I gave it up, so many caches, so little time.  Yesterday I got a message from the PPs and they asked if I wanted to accompany them to the final today.  Well DUh!  I brought my daughters and The Tilley Hat came too.  The mosquitoes were brutal but we braved them and came up with a cache.  Recent trail work in the area made getting off trail a bit rough too.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Very interesting information about the web notes.  I had never heard of them until this cache made the introduction.  I got a little frustrated with the puzzle only because one of the websites I used presented some of the information a little differently than I think it should have (and differently than another website I used to finally get the right answer).  Once I found the other website I changed one of my answers and I was good to go.  Found this one on the way to my dad's for Easter dinner.  The container was very hard to open due to sitting all winter and could probably use a little help.  Otherwise, excellent puzzle and hide!  TFTC and the info on web notes!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We had pretty much given up on this one after seeing all the DNFs. One of our foursome had already found this and was back at the car waiting for us, so we called him for help and he wasn't able to give us much to go on other than what he remembered as far as the type of container and proximity from the trail. We searched some more, still nothing, and I had already marked the DNF in my GPS but we were still reluctant to give up. I went and checked an area I had checked once already (and I believe at least one other cacher in the group had checked). Cache was buried pretty deep under the leaves, but there it was. As Striving said, the contents were damp, but we were able to sign the log. After reading all the logs that said the coords were off, we were surprised nobody had suggested better coords to use, so Striving did an average and posted some that should be a little better for future finders. Glad to not have to submit a DNF log for this. TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">In the 1800's it was rumored that Silas R had a treasure people hoped that they would inherit. Silas being surrounded by his fortune hunting family decided to hide it so it would remain safe. Upon his demise no one seemed to know what or where this treasure had been hidden. The town went on wondering while Silas' cousin Billy Frey moved away taking the secret with him. So once you find Billy's place you will be that much closer to the treasure.


Billy says be sure to stop by and rest your weary bones, because the end of the trail to the big tree is Killer!</groundspeak:long_description>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Every summer, the little nebulas spend a week vacationing at the 1000 Islands.  The past four years, they have returned home from their trip to find a scavenger hunt of clues and riddles leading them around the house, and eventually to a Grand Prize.  Last summer, since we had just started caching, geocaching made its way into the scavenger hunt, and along the way each of the kids got a container that they could use to place their very own hide.  It has taken over a year, but their "Scavenger Hunt (SH)" caches are now hidden. 

This is N3’s hide, along the Crescent Trail as it climbs up Horizon Hill along the golf course at Woodcliff.  He had this location and style of hide picked out many months ago, and prepared the container and logbook himself.  He came up with the name for the cache, did most of the work on the hide, and supplied his own dollar as a FTF prize.  

You are looking for a matchstick container.  Please take care with the cache.  When finding it, please take a moment before retrieving to see exactly how it is hidden, so you can rehide the same way for the next cachers.  There are a couple possible entry points to the trail, referenced below.  Please refrain from using the nearby office building parking lot; it could draw undue attention to the cache location, and the walk from either trailhead is short and pleasant.

Also, in order to tie the Scavenger Hunt caches together as a mini-series, I have added some clues on the first page of the log sheet; please note them, and you may find them useful in the future.

***Note - 9/25/2010:  The original style of this hide was a lot of fun, but it is clear that it will  require too much maintenance to keep up to par.  Going forward this is a more traditional style hide.***

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I took the more scenic route to the cache and with the snow just starting to fall, it made it even more scenic. I found the well tucked away cache and signed the log. I thought the trail was a loop for some reason and continued down the trail when I should have turned around. I got a little mixed up and took the paved walk around the blocks back to parking. Nice little trail. TFTC</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I had a delivery this morning at the Woodcliff Hotel &amp; Spa. Being I was already parked in one of the suggested parking spots I made the .3 mile hike down the trail and made a quick find. The previous cacher didn't make it an obvious find as they left many tracks in the snow and hide the container well. Great camo job. I replaced cache as found. Now to make the hike up the hill in the rain. TNLN, TFTC</groundspeak:text>

There was even less joy for me when I got home and realized that I've had this in my GPS so long I was looking for a micro using the first set of coords.  Doh!  Shouldn't have mattered, though, as I widened the search area quite a bit before heading back to the car.

I'll be back to try again as soon as I can.  Thanks for the challenge!</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;div class="UserSuppliedContent"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This hike is more than a mile each way and features a clamber up Indian Hill followed by a very nice (mostly wooded) hike along the Yellow to the Blue and on to the Orange trails of the Crescent Trail System. This well maintained trail system winds it way through private property so PLEASE stay on the trails until within about 100 feet of the cache.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;span&gt;I chose the hottest day of the year to go after "Orange You Glad It's No Further" and after hiking up the hill and making it ALMOST all the way, I ran into a Trail Closed Ahead sign.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7104/7403834960_fe047c6bfd_m.jpg" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I said (expletive deleted).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I forged on, hoping I would reach the cache before I reached the next sign. Before I got to the cache, I came to Trail Closed For Maintenance sign posted by the Crescent Trail Association.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8010/7403835504_b84f297618_m.jpg" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I said (expletive deleted)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I called the Cresent Trail Association, hoping they would give me the OK to proceed. After getting a taped message, I said (expletive deleted).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I called the Perinton Parks Department. Another voice mail. Another deleted expletive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I texted Tber1981 (who found it recently). I was hoping the signs were here when she found the cache and she would encourage me to continue on. She replied the signs weren't there for her. My text back to her was (you guessed it) another expletive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I don't look good in stripes, so i decided to turn around. But in order to make the trip worthwhile, I thought I would plant this little cache near where I was turned around by the signs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There's a little twist involved here. Let me know if it results in an expletive of your own.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is good parking at the Indian Hill Trail Head Parking Area just off of Route 31 east of Turk Hill Road. PLEASE make the hike and don't take a short cut through someone’s yard. Don't make me sic the caching police on you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Posted hours are 8:00am to Dusk. If you are not familiar with the trails, you may want to print out a &lt;a href="http://www.perinton.org/Data/Documents/crescent%20trail/Map1_06-09-10.pdf"&gt;trail map&lt;/a&gt; before you go.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first to find prize is shiny Susan B. Anthony dollar - to be awarded almost any Sunday morning at 8:30 AM. (It's not in the cache.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;CONGRATS TO THE MACK4 FOR THE FIRST TO FIND!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Yup--clever, clever--but happily some of us were a bit familiar with some of the tricks of caching--and still found "expletive deleted." Though it took some time--and thought--and broadening our search area because of jumping coords--even with two gps receivers. Had fun too--A, Gadget CHC and I had an excellent hike. The trillium was blooming and although it was chilly for May, we had a very pleasant walk. This was our third new cache of the day. Happy caching.   

Oh yes--A just bought a Tilley Hat at EMS (following our son who got one in Canada). He had to replace a hat that inadvertently acquired a "moonroof" while caching. 

Loved the story and the photos on the cache page. It reminds me of one caching hike that we took in Colorado on North Table Mountain a couple of years ago where at least three caches were off limits because of trail changes and area maintenance. [:)]</groundspeak:text>

Hmmmmm  now for the next part which I had a tough time finding but eventually got it, excellent placement !!   The final was an interesting find, another tough trek getting there.

Twelfth in a series of "Quacked-Up!" Rubber Ducky
Holidays!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt;
&lt;font size="5"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Well folks .. here is number 12.  It has been a great caching
year for me and the ducks. I have truly enjoyed putting out these
duck caches for you, and enjoyed all the comments in the logs and
face to face.  There may yet be a few duck caches up my sleeve
but this is the last for this series!  Please enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;Cache is a LARGE
lock n lock I have filled with Christmas and winter themed
Rubber Duckies. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;There are Santas and reindeer and carolers,
some smaller elves and snowmen .. and more, all just waiting for
good homes.&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font face="Comic Sans MS"
size="4"&gt;&lt;font color="#16AB31"&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;
Feel free to grab a duck to take home to celebrate this special
time with you and your family. There are no clues to collect, 
just a duck to adopt if you wish.  These ducks ARE trade
items. Please leave a trade in their place so we don't end up with
a big container with just a log book. I will get out and refill a
couple of times and put out a smaller container at some
point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;font color="#008000"&gt;The area where I placed
the cache is near where I found my very first cache all by
myself.  That cache was recently archived so I found a place
nearby where a larger container would fit. Please re-hide well as I
did see some evidence of partying nearby. The cache should be
accessible all winter unless we have a very heavy snowfall.
Approach from the trail side. There are Lollypop Farms posted signs
up, as there are throughout all the trails on their property. So
please respect the area, stop in and see the animals and maybe
bring home a new friend to geocache with (not sure how well the
bunnies would do at that though). There is parking available
at Egypt Park (when gates are open and during posted
hours) OR at Lollypop Farm OR at the trail-head on Victor
Road.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;Stay with the theme if you can,
but any trade is just fine.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;font face="Comic Sans MS"&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;
&lt;u&gt;&lt;font color="#008000"&gt;Please just one duck per person or
caching family!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">I hope your bikes are in working order, because that is the intended mode of transportation for this series. Between Palmyra and Newark there are 12 colored bison tubes placed along the Erie Canal Trail. Each cache will count as a separate smiley, so be sure to sign each log. On six of the bison tubes there is a metal tag with a letter and a number. Make note of this information, as it will be needed to find the final in the series: “Erie Canalside Bike Ride: Grand Finale”. The caches containing this information will not be designated on the cache pages, so you must find all 12 micros to get the final. Please do not mention anything about getting needed information in your logs, or they will be deleted. Not knowing which caches have final coord information is part of the fun (for me anyway)! The series is about 17 miles round trip, assuming you start at the posted parking coordinates. The terrain rating on the caches will get higher the further they are from the parking coordinates, because this series is meant to be done in one trip. Happy pedaling!</groundspeak:long_description>

We didn't park at the given parking coords, as it was after dark.  Instead, we parked down the road and road our bikes to the path. We left the truck shortly after 9pm and returned to the truck near 1am. 

It took some searching, but we came up with the find.  Not sure if it was SUPPOSED to be in the location we found it, but we returned it exactly as found.

Had to stop once or twice half way up to catch my breath but eventually made my way to GZ. My GPS did not want to settle in and I was not having much luck. Spent more time searching GZ than making the ascent from the pearly gates. I was about to give up when I spotted something and went to check it out. Soon had the cache in hand and signed the log.

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">I hope your bikes are in working order, because that is the intended mode of transportation for this series. Between Palmyra and Newark there are 12 colored bison tubes placed along the Erie Canal Trail. Each cache will count as a separate smiley, so be sure to sign each log. On six of the bison tubes there is a metal tag with a letter and a number. Make note of this information, as it will be needed to find the final in the series: “Erie Canalside Bike Ride: Grand Finale”. The caches containing this information will not be designated on the cache pages, so you must find all 12 micros to get the final. Please do not mention anything about getting needed information in your logs, or they will be deleted. Not knowing which caches have final coord information is part of the fun (for me anyway)! The series is about 17 miles round trip, assuming you start at the posted parking coordinates. The terrain rating on the caches will get higher the further they are from the parking coordinates, because this series is meant to be done in one trip. Happy pedaling!

***Update 8/27/12: This cache is now a cammoed bison tube, although there may be a little something that makes it easier to spot.</groundspeak:long_description>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Tilley and Striving have always "threatened" us (MacCrew and Pep) with releasing a new cache every time we cleared Indian Hill area. And we believe them. They have kept their word so far. It is a great walk on these peaceful trails, once you get up that dreaded hill!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We were out caching with Striving and Taz on a normal Sunday, and decided to go find our last 2 unfound caches on the hill since it was such a beautiful day out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Today, we decided to hang back and let the guys get ahead of us, so we could hide a cache for all of them to find next time they are here, and everyone else too. Its a micro, the only thing we had on us for a spur of the moment hide, but should be easy to find.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">An early morning errand got me out of the house before anyone else. After a trip to the other side of the city, thought I'd try sneaking in a few caches before the 'heat' of the day. That was the plan anyway until leaving the house at 6:15AM and already having it 77degrees out!

On my way to the Fairport Ball Fields to do a ring of caches, I remembered there had been a few caches placed toward the end of the Crescent Trail that I hadn't had time to visit. My travels were taking me right by them and there isn't anything like an expected 90+ degree day to hike up and down the hill here!

Decided to take the full walk in and cache my way out. Didn't realize I had more unfound caches here than I thought. Found the trails to be quiet except for one lone runner. Boy, that shows dedication on a day like today!

This was the fourth and sixth stop of 17 tries and 15 finds. Not bad for an oppressive humid day!

Never got the GPSr to really like one area. Took the general average and did a nice ring out from there several times. Reached out to the CO and got enough information to narrow things down a little. Surprisingly, woods seem to have a lot of trees in them! [;)] Came up empty in the end despite finding lots of great hidey holes to place things.

Guess my hiking along these trails hasn't come to an end yet!</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">I hope your bikes are in working order, because that is the intended mode of transportation for this series. Between Palmyra and Newark there are 12 colored bison tubes placed along the Erie Canal Trail. Each cache will count as a separate smiley, so be sure to sign each log. On six of the bison tubes there is a metal tag with a letter and a number. Make note of this information, as it will be needed to find the final in the series: “Erie Canalside Bike Ride: Grand Finale”. The caches containing this information will not be designated on the cache pages, so you must find all 12 micros to get the final. Please do not mention anything about getting needed information in your logs, or they will be deleted. Not knowing which caches have final coord information is part of the fun (for me anyway)! The series is about 17 miles round trip, assuming you start at the posted parking coordinates. The terrain rating on the caches will get higher the further they are from the parking coordinates, because this series is meant to be done in one trip. Happy pedaling!</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I have never looked for so long for a cache. For some reason, I just could not bring myself to stop looking. Everytime I would stand up and head down the trail, something called me back. I did this for 90 minutes, the final few times using some adult language. I just KNEW what I was looking for but could not come up with it. After giving up and heading to the next cache I began a new search. After a minute or two, I followed my GPS (against my instincts) I found this stinkin thing right where it should be, just not where I was looking before. 

I spend 90  minutes looking for this thing in the wrong spot after mixing up my wp's. It was a chilly november day so no one was around to hear my frustration, just maybe some ringing in Captain Jon's ears. All of the WP's were in good shape and WP1 seemed to be in a logical place, moved? maybe, but I found it relitavly quickly.</groundspeak:text>

Sometimes being in the woods gives you a different outlook on things. Thoughts become clearer and you can sort things out in some order. On this real trail, there are actually roots, but you have to admire the twisted and sculptured trees along the way. A little different from the square posts at the trail head. You have to be a very vigilant thinker and a Dürer.

Container is a micro. Please bring your own pencil or pen. FTF gets a dollar coin.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">The DeltaDelta1 trail puzzles were some of the first higher difficulty puzzles I did- often reaching out to the CO for a nudge or two.  I solved all of these several years ago but never managed to go seek the hides and sign the logs. Today I found two of his puzzle hides. This one was a stumper but a phone call set me in the right place. What a clever hide! It needs some maintenance and I have contacted the CO, but the log is dry and ready for a signature, if you can find it.  Thank you for a great puzzle and a really sneaky, fun little hide!</groundspeak:text>

This puzzle has been in the solved pile for quite a while, and we never seemed to be in the right area to make the find.  After meeting up with the CO at his golden puzzle this morning, we were determined to get here today.  Even armed with some very detailed information about what to look for, this was still a difficult find.  Cheryyll managed to spot it while I was fighting with my phone trying to complete one last-ditch PAF to the CO.  A very clever container indeed.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I solved this excellent puzzle shortly after Trails with Roots.  Thankfully, this one fell a little quicker (not fast...just quicker) than the first in the series.  (I attribute that to the "training" the first one gave me!)  I knew I would be heading close by the cache location this morning, so it was on my "must do" list for the day.  Once again I can say that thanks to caching I am introduced to a spot I never knew existed.  (Thanks for pointing it out to me!)  A short walk to GZ and I was faced with a countless number of hiding spots.  As if that didn't present enough of a challenge, the CO made it even tougher with the clever hide.  Stumbled around in circles for a while until I found it.  I'm happy to have my name on the log of this very nicely done puzzle and cache.  Thanks for the fun!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">An early morning errand got me out of the house before anyone else. After a trip to the other side of the city, thought I'd try sneaking in a few caches before the 'heat' of the day. That was the plan anyway until leaving the house at 6:15AM and already having it 77degrees out!

On my way to the Fairport Ball Fields to do a ring of caches, I remembered there had been a few caches placed toward the end of the Crescent Trail that I hadn't had time to visit. My travels were taking me right by them and there isn't anything like an expected 90+ degree day to hike up and down the hill here!

Decided to take the full walk in and cache my way out. Didn't realize I had more unfound caches here than I thought. Found the trails to be quiet except for one lone runner. Boy, that shows dedication on a day like today!

This was the fifth stop of 17 tries and 15 finds. Not bad for an oppressive humid day!

Bounced around for a bit and thought I was going to take my second DNF for the day. Ringed the area twice focusing on the wrong type of hide. Just before calling it an adventure, caught something from the corner of my eye. Had a heck of a time retrieving the container but finally wiggled it out and was able to sign in.

Thanks for the nice hike and tricky hide!</groundspeak:text>

As BT mentioned, this one seemed a bit exposed, but I think it's one of those hides that you'd walk right by and not notice anything out of the ordinary unless you knew there was something there.  We found it only because we were looking for it.

Thanks for pointing out this spot to us, and thanks for the hide!</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">A nice easy stroll that takes you through freshwater wetlands, upland meadow, wooded wetlands, ponds and a brook.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winter accessible cache in a wonderful area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew about this little park, but had never been here, and I realized it didn't have any caches placed in it yet. My planting trip was the first time I went to this park, and I was pleasantly surprised. The short description above comes from the town of Perinton's website about this park, and it's amazing how diverse such a short trail can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 2/3 of the hike is through wetlands, much of it on a boardwalk. At the time of placement, there was a bit of an overgrowth over the boardwalk, but that is actually a positive addition. Most of the rest is through an open meadow, with a short hike through the wooded wetlands. The cache should be safe from water in the spring, but I don't know how accessible it will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a standard ammo box, with an assortment of items for both kids and adults (mostly kids). Cache is just slightly off the trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy your visit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warnings:&lt;br /&gt;
- The boardwalk can get VERY slippery when wet. I took my kids there today for a hike, and all 3 of us slipped at least once.&lt;br /&gt;
- Both times I've been here the weather was cool: no bugs. Since this is a wetland area, I imagine in warmer weather the bugs could get bad. So bring bug spray just in case.&lt;/p&gt;

We had a slippery walk on the boardwalk but both managed to stay dry...I almost wiped out when we were almost back to the car though! As we approached GZ, the geosenses pointed to the same spot that the GPS did. After a couple of swipes to get the snow out of the way, we had the ammo can in place. Thanks for keeping this one going and for bringing us to this really cool park! I'll have to come back in warmer (and somewhat drier) weather to see what kind of wildlife I can spot.

This is a nice walk in the woods.  Nothing too strenuous but it's not by the road either. Probably a 30-40 minute round trip.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">I was out the other day with my GPS and my USGS topo map.  There seems to be a discrepancy......What the heck.....batteries????....Darn, guess I'll have to use the map....

This should be a fairly easy cipher for all you crazy cachers out there.
Sorry, roundoff error precludes the use of coordinate checker.
Enjoy the challenge

Congratulations Wheelygood for FTF!!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This is another one of those that didn't come to me the first few times I looked at it but knowing we would be going to Powder Mills soon, I put in some more concentrated effort this morning. Used two techniques that unfortunately came up about 700 feet apart! Oh well I sent CO a note for help. But right after sending it, my wife said, "let's go now"
So off we went with my two options. As we followed some trails, I started to suspect which one might be right and which one was definitely wrong.  We started our search when we got to ~100 feet to hedge our bets. Eventually we found this elusive one and we were with 25 feet of my calculated GZ. Pretty good in my book. 
Surprised to find several trackables here so we grabbed a couple to move on. Interesting puzzle and nice walk. TFTC</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well, you have confirmed something for me - this kind of container won't last multiple years in the wild!  I have several of these that I have used for geocaching containers, and they have held up decent in the 2+ years they have been out there.  But this one has been out there 4+ years, and it is definitely wet inside.  If you read back through the logs, you will see that finders have been noting a wet log book for quite a while now.  The contents were all damaged and moldy, so I think it's time to look at a different container.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was the last in a series of caches for me today on my lunch hour.  I had recently solved a different puzzle, and saw that the coordinates took me generally near this cache, so I figured I better solve this one also.  Thanks to the cache owner for quickly responding to verify that my calculations and the resulting coordinates were, as he put it, "close enough for government work!"  I had an awesome hike on my lunch hour today, and believe it or not, I was sweating like crazy.  The coordinates I had took me to a different area, but I kept expanding, and eventually came up with the find.  I suppose that is highly likely with the error introduced through several calulation steps.  Cache is damp and musty (see my maintenance log).  Thanks for the puzzle, I learned something interesting, and thanks for confirming my calculations.  But most of all, thanks for the awesome lunch time hike!!!</groundspeak:text>

This morning I was heading very near GZ so I knew that the day had finally come to follow this one through to the end.  Enjoyed working on the puzzle which showed me something new, and had a great walk in this part of the park.  Found the cache quickly which turned out to be a good thing.  Saw a few bees hovering near GZ (not at, but close).  Not wanting to disturb a possible hive, I signed in quickly (log was just a bit damp but I had no problem signing in) and headed off to another spot.

The potential is there for some wet hikes but today was nice and dry. This was the more challenging hunts of the day. Coords were great, led me straight to the hide. No trades, just signed the log.

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This is a Finger Lakes ACA cache; check the bookmark for others.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The winter of 2012 - 2013 was long and gray. We (Teamajk, DeltaDelta1 and Yurtles ) coped with the early winter of 2013 by turning our backs on it. Solving puzzle caches was a good way to keep warm and dry and entertained. Cache puzzles posed by sujojeepers and mcdurr in California and Bumble! in Massachusetts were particularly challenging and educational. Each puzzle we solved was based on a different cipher from this American Cryptogram Association list. Click &lt;a target="_ blank" href="http://www.cryptogram.org/cipher_types.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Now we want to share the fun with you by placing some ACA cipher caches in the Finger Lakes area. Good luck and have fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is not at the posted cache coordinates. You must solve the puzzle to get the cache. There are four one dollar gold coins for the first four solver/finders. Please bring your own pencil or pen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The method of solution to this puzzle follows the example of this cipher in the ACA list of ciphers. The only thing that is different are the keywords. Once you learned the method of this cipher, you may actually solve the puzzle before you get the keywords.&lt;/p&gt;

This was another puzzle where my tools only did so much, and quite a bit of brain power was required.  It was fun to see the decryption appear bit by bit.  After doing quite a bit of hiking today, the short walk and quick find were much appreciated!  Since I'm not likely to make it to any of the far-flung caches that inspired this series any time soon, it's been really fun having these caches appear within driving distance.

I touched on the right thing, but never made the connection.  Eventually I was ready to give up, and I received a small hint, but it got me working on it again, and with my son looking over my shoulder, we finally got it figured out.
Today, we were headed out this way, so we put this at the top of the list.  Made this our forst stop, and after a brief search, the SilverFox spotted it.
Another nice new puzzle.

Probably didn't help that the GPSr seemed to bounce around during previous visits. It always seemed to like this area eventually though.

As before, missed the container during my sweep. A change of perspective proved more fruitful and my heart leapt with joy! [:D] Nice to finally get this off my DNF list!

I'd worked out the coordinates back when it was a puzzle and am happy to make the find before the cache had run its span. Thanks!</groundspeak:text>

So, you will have to get something tall that can fit into an ammo box. Many people think that this isn't the higest point but it is. This is Gannett Hill Park NOT Gannett Hill. The Mees Observatory owns the land for the higest point. Thanks for understanding!

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">The Jumpoff cache is located in Ontario County Park on Gannett Hill at one of the highest locations in Western-Central New York.  It is at the 2000 ft. altitude mark.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Note: Signs say the park is closed, but as of 10-20-01 there was still vehicle access to the park.  Camping and picnicing is closed only.  Also you can park at the bottom of the road and walk up the hill to the cache.
&lt;P&gt;

The park is located at the highest point in Ontario County in the Bristol Hills (410 acres).  At an elevation of 2256 feet above sea level you'll have expansive views to the East viewing portions of Ontario County and the hills behind Seneca and Cayuga Lakes.  From the "Lookout" (Jumpoff) you will be able to view the Bristol Hills.
&lt;P&gt;
Although the cache can be found closer to the road, parking at the Lookout-Jumpoff area will provide for the wonderful views with only minimal additional mileage on your feet. Parking lot is at N42 42.549, W77 24.922.  Walk towards the jumpoff even though your GPS unit shows differently.  At the jumpoff take the trail to the left heading South.  This is the start of the Bristol Branch of the Finger Lakes Trail System.  See &lt;A HREF="http://www.fingerlakes.net"&gt;www.fingerlakes.net&lt;/A&gt; for more information on the FLT.
&lt;P&gt;
This cache is fairly easy and suitable for families and a picnic in the park.  It is located near an area where tree leaf cover will not interfer with satellite reception.  The cache itself is under a tree close to one of the many paths in the area.
&lt;P&gt;
Have fun, good picnicing and enjoy the views.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I started by walking to the Jump Off after parking nearby.  After enjoying the view on this beautiful sunny morning, I followed the trail south from there for a distance' enjoying the views even though at this season they are somewhat blocked by bushes.  I was using map mode on my iPhone 5 and I soon realized I was getting no nearer to the cache.  I had fallen in Clarks Gulch the day before and my knee was a bit unhappy, so I returned to the car and drove to a closer parking area and followed the bicycle trail and then the Park Trail which very quickly took me close to the cache.  The coords were off a bit for me, but considering when this was placed, they are totally acceptable. This is a fine cache and deserves to have better contents.  I left a stunt coin trackable that I had picked up in Virginia.</groundspeak:text>

We expected one side of the street and were surprised to see we had to go to the other. The view nearby was just beautiful! We really wished there was more room the snap a family shot right in front of the falls, but that would have lead to quite the game of Frogger! Thanks for sharing this location!

Well, the ducks and I were sitting around talking about July and
deciding what holiday to celebrate... when one duck started
complaining that humans just keep celebrating the same old
holidays every year. I tried to explain about traditions and all
that but soon he had all the ducks agreeing that we needed to
celebrate something a bit more unique!  So, I broke out the
calendar with the lesser known "holidays" and they found one they
liked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#BB0626"&gt;July 9th is
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rock and Roll Day!&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;   (hey, it's
on my calendar...honest!)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;font color="#16AB31"&gt;Soon all the
ducks had dressed for the part and were organizing a Rock Band! So,
here's to Rock and Roll, may it live forever!&lt;br /&gt;

 Cache is a larger lock-n-lock container filled with Rubber
Duckies that are busy singing, dancing and playing
instruments.&lt;/font&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"&gt;&lt;font color="#16AB31"&gt;Feel free
to grab a duck to take home to celebrate this special time with you
and your family.&lt;br /&gt;
 If you don't wish to adopt a duck, please make sure to make a note
of the symbol written on the bottom&lt;br /&gt;
of the ducks, in the log or on the laminated picture of the ducks
stuck to the lid of the cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 You will need to know the symbol associated with each
"Quacked-Up!" Holiday cache in order&lt;br /&gt;
 to find the bonus cache in the series.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 You do not need a trade item to take a duck but:&lt;br id="" /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;font face="Comic Sans MS"&gt;&lt;font color="#16AB31"&gt;
Please just one duck per person or caching family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

Travel bugs and coins always welcome! Bring the family, kids will
especially like the holiday caches (and the ducks).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="#BB0626"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The trails to the cache are sometimes very muddy so I HIGHLY
recommend that you wear your boots.  There are 3 ways in to
the trail that I know about, one is much muddier than the other
two. I will post trailheads coords after the FTF. No complaints
about the mud, the ducks loved it and you have been warned. It's an
easy walk from any of the trailheads, very flat with a few small
bridges. Because of the mud I am rating the terrain a
2.5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 Congrats to hjathome for the FTF!&lt;br /&gt;

It is usually dry and runs along the creek for a while and then along a field. It is not the shortest but you can park at a couple of nearby businesses so you won't need to leave your car on the road.&lt;br /&gt;T21TK6R - Trailhead #2&lt;br /&gt;N 43° 04.025 W 077° 24.095&lt;br /&gt;Trailhead here is not marked as such but is an obvious trail and there is a trail marker further in to let you know you are on the trail. This is probably closest to the cache but not as nice a walk as #1. There is a bit more mud in rainy season. You need to make it a quick cache, this will work, but if you have time go for #1. Coords here will be off some as I am just using Google maps but will get you to the area.&lt;br /&gt;T31TK6R - Trailhead #3&lt;br /&gt;N 43° 04.285 W 077° 24.095&lt;br /&gt;This is the longest way in and at times it is very very muddy so keep that in mind, but it's a pretty walk and you can stop at a pretty area with a place to relax and watch nature. If you are doing the other caches to the northeast, this would be a good way to continue on and get this cache.&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Challenge&lt;/b&gt;. Click &lt;a rel="nofollow" href=
"http://home.roadrunner.com/~tazd/AYTE/index.html"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt; to find
out more about the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been a number of tough hides of the micro variety
lately in this challenge that have taken some of the fun out of
caching and left people scratching their heads wonder why they do
this. It got me thinking about why I got into caching. I remembered
the fun of going on long hikes in the woods with a nice ammo can to
find. So it's time to get back to basics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a nice long hike along the Crescent Trail in Perinton,
approximately 3.5 miles round trip. &lt;b&gt;Please note that bicycles
are allowed on the flat blue trail next to the canal.&lt;/b&gt; The
terrain rating is only because of the length of the hike. Once you
get down the trail a little ways you will need to decide between
two paths to get back to where the cache is located. The yellow
trail takes you on a more interesting path with some ups and downs
that is mostly covered in cool shade. There are some wet spots
along the way and there is a lot of poison ivy along the sides of
the trail so long pants is strongly recommended. The blue trail is
mostly flat and gets a lot of warm sunshine. There is a lot less
poison ivy this way, but there are some prickly berry bushes that
can bite you as you go by. Both of these trails run close by the
canal and will get you to where you need to go. You can find a
trail map on the Perinton town web site &lt;a rel="nofollow" href=
"http://www.perinton.org/Data/Documents/crescent%20trail/Map2,03.30.05.pdf"&gt;
HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a 30 cal ammo can filled with some nice swag. I
tried to keep it out of the poison ivy in the area but do be
careful while searching. Once you've found it, add your name to the
log book and when you write your online log/note for the find
please include the number with your log entry. Please only one
cacher per line in the log book. There is a "lammy" for the FTF. In
addition, the FTF'er can choose any item from the swag as a FTF
prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because this is an AYTE Challenge cache I will be holding off
giving any hints for a period of one week after publication, but
you will really not need any for this cache. If for some reason you
are having trouble I will be happy to be of assistance after a
week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congratulations to ChileHead on the FTF!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK1V34Q - Parking&lt;br /&gt;N 43° 05.138 W 077° 24.104&lt;br /&gt;Parking area.&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well this was the reason we came out here. After wrong turns, horse flies and all kinds of bumps we made it!  Our first thought was to approach by kayak but we decided to bike to grab other caches in the area. I am glad we did!

This was a hike in!  Thanks so much for the great adventure. I think this one would last forever out hre just because of how remote it is.

I had a great time riding out here with Sase and going in circles.  He made the comment about the adventure beinmg over...little did we know how hard it was to get back from here!

Thanks again for a great cache and a great time!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">BroTim and I figured we'd grab this one before it got archived, and BT's original plan was to launch a  kayak nearby and come in to this one from the water.  This morning he suggested we bike it in instead so we could grab others in these trails.  Works for me!

We made this quite and aventure, it certainly would have been easier had we done the smart thing and brought a trail map.  However a few wrong turns we took just led us to more caches anyway so it all worked out and we still got to this one in very good timing.  Cache is still very healthy.

Thanks for the cache, this was quite a workout and we had plenty of fun.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Headed out solo this morning to grab this cache before it gets archived. Started on the yellow trail and scared up a deer, rabbit and lots of blue heron.  The trail is well marked, but there is poison ivy on the edges. Got to admit that it was a little spooky out there alone. But found the cache and the other nearby cache with no problems. Both are in good shape. Made my way back by the blue trail, got rained on, and donated some blood to the local bug population. I should have taken the bug spray along. All in all it was a nice hike and glad I finally have my name on this logbook.</groundspeak:text>

I had window of time that would only allow me  to get this cache and not the nearby Habenero cache so I will be back here soon probably.  This was a great cache and yes I would say that this reminds me of why geocaching was so fun for us. Great hike to find an ammo can in the woods, excellent to have this one done.

This is called the Pez Hotel because I wanted to combine two of my favorite hobbies. I am asking that cachers swap and trade only PEZ dispensers. Please keep the theme going.

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">I hope your bikes are in working order, because that is the intended mode of transportation for this series. Between Palmyra and Newark there are 12 colored bison tubes placed along the Erie Canal Trail. Each cache will count as a separate smiley, so be sure to sign each log. On six of the bison tubes there is a metal tag with a letter and a number. Make note of this information, as it will be needed to find the final in the series: “Erie Canalside Bike Ride: Grand Finale”. The caches containing this information will not be designated on the cache pages, so you must find all 12 micros to get the final. Please do not mention anything about getting needed information in your logs, or they will be deleted. Not knowing which caches have final coord information is part of the fun (for me anyway)! The series is about 17 miles round trip, assuming you start at the posted parking coordinates. The terrain rating on the caches will get higher the further they are from the parking coordinates, because this series is meant to be done in one trip. Happy pedaling!</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Enjoyed our walk on the canal on this lovely afternoon and also were very happy to find this cache--and the hint helped a great deal. For people like us--hints are very useful--I guess we are not the most patient types--we love to hike and cache (it is obvious that you like to cycle and cache--our grandson Kaelhop likes that too--we would too--if we had bikes.) Thanks for this one.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was the first Bike Ride Cache I've found.  I don't have a bike so..., but electra1315 wanted to take a walk and try to find a couple hides in this series.  OK, so now I'm hooked.  I don't live in the area, but I'll find them all eventually.  We found 3 today.

Looking at the hint would have made for a faster find, but we discovered it after a few minutes.  This will be a toughy in the winter.

Thanks for the series.  I may have to borrow a bike from someone.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Greetings!

I noticed that your cache has the needs maintenance attribute set.  This is generally caused when a cacher posts a "needs maintenance log on  your cache for a number of reasons.  If you have addressed the issue or believe there is no issue, you can remove this attribute by posting an "owner maintenance" log, or editing the attribute list to remove it (note on caches other than traditional, the needs maintenance icon does not show, but clicking "Update Attributes" will clear it anyway.)

Often people will filter out caches that require maintenance so making sure this is correct will help cachers find your cache.

If you haven't addressed the issue, go out and find a few caches and fix this one on the way back!  [:)]

If you try to go the endless loop or Dino one there's  no way to cross the river. I tried to find a spot you have to go to the road and drive to the Dino and endless loop caches.  Just thought I'd let you know and save you some time. Cheers</groundspeak:text>

Our guess was right and we solved it in less than a minute! Decided to go for it today. We had not planned on the trail being a treacherous, icy mess. After making the find, we opted for an alternative route back and that proved slightly better. Thanks for the excellent puzzle and cache.</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">I hope your bikes are in working order, because that is the intended mode of transportation for this series. Between Palmyra and Newark there are 12 colored bison tubes placed along the Erie Canal Trail. Each cache will count as a separate smiley, so be sure to sign each log. On six of the bison tubes there is a metal tag with a letter and a number. Make note of this information, as it will be needed to find the final in the series: “Erie Canalside Bike Ride: Grand Finale”. The caches containing this information will not be designated on the cache pages, so you must find all 12 micros to get the final. Please do not mention anything about getting needed information in your logs, or they will be deleted. Not knowing which caches have final coord information is part of the fun (for me anyway)! The series is about 17 miles round trip, assuming you start at the posted parking coordinates. The terrain rating on the caches will get higher the further they are from the parking coordinates, because this series is meant to be done in one trip. Happy pedaling!</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I tried to do this entirely as the CO directed.  I parked at the original parking coordinates, and looked for every cache that the CO has not acknowledged as gone.  I collected clues while peddling a super stretch of the canal path.  I was all kinds of bikers, boaters, fishermen, joggers, and I'm sure a few thought I was wacky.  In particular, there were fishermen I couldn't shake who'd be right near the shore I was searching in boats fishing, and joggers and bikers I kept overlapping with.

It is very well done!
Man this one was a long time coming for me!
I started this one a couple of weeks ago, starting at the 
Newark McDonalds and riding west.
On that day I found all but 3 or 4 hides (these were DNF's because of muggles).
So last week I started out in the Palmyra park and rode east and got the missing
hides. Wile at McDonalds in Newark for lunch a entered the cords. I had gathered.
And headed back west to end up with a DNF on this finale.
Running out of time I rode back to my truck.
Then midweek a took my bike to Swift Landing Park and rode east to what ended up being
the wrong cords. I was close but not close enough.
That brings me to day, I started again at McDonalds stopping and rechecking the hides along the way.
It wasn't long before I found the one that I had wrong. (Some of the tags are very hard to read!)
With the right cords. I soon had the log in hand.
Seeing that I had logged this so quickly today, I rode on west back to the Palmyra park to find the 
"Kaidyn's Treasures Cache".
So for anyone keeping score I did ride this loop 3 and 1/2 times or over 50 miles total!</groundspeak:text>

After a brief re-grouping we were signing in and we were happy to have completed a great series.  We found all in the group with the exception of numeral #3.  That one will haunt me.</groundspeak:text>

We enjoyed the location and I took one side while C4 took the other and his side turned out to be where the nicely hidden final was hidden.  Happy to sign into this one.

Thanks for all the work you did on this nice series.  We had been looking forward to hitting it for quite a while and it was worth the wait for this picture perfect day.  We had a great time putting the miles on the bike today and finding caches along the way.  Thanks again for a great series.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Wow.  This was a wonderful series.  We started in Newark and biked west.  As we biked the trail and put the necessary clues into the comment area of the GPSr; we were disappointed when we went to retrieve the clues and found that we could not manually pull them back out.  We had to go home and retrieve them when we hooked up to the computer.  So, we biked all the way back to the vehicle parked in Newark.  Sore butts, but a good journey.  Drove home and got the necessary information to complete the puzzle.  Should have done the old fashioned method of pen and paper.  Finally found the chance to get back and grab this cache.  The difficulty and terrain were rated well - found the terrain a little more difficult than it should have been - probably due to the new glasses and the dizzying effect of getting used to them!  Thanks for the effort, the placement, the cost and the care of your caches . . . and creating so much fun for so many people.</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This cache is located on my favorite trail in this area.  The trail is well-marked, but it is VERY muddy this time of year, so dress accordingly. The terrain rating reflects the possibility of mud or a washed out trail.  There is no need to climb any trees.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache was supposed to be my first hide, but ended up being my second, due to the trail being completely washed out on my first attempt to hide it. When you reach the first fork in the trail, bear right.  You will feel like you are going to go into someone's backyard, but the trail quickly veers back into the woods.  Please be aware that a couple of tree limbs have fallen across the trail, but they are pretty easy to navigate around. I highly recommend taking the time to hike the rest of the trail, as it is beautiful.   It is stocked with the normal cache stuff: log book and pencils, trade items, and a newly activated TB, "My Favorite Car".  Due to the heavy tree cover I had some GPS issues, but it said the coords were good within 20 feet.    Happy hunting!

As I don't know from which side of the trail you will be approaching this cache, this hint might not work for you, but for us the cache was on the left side of the trail just before the foot bridge.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">An early morning errand got me out of the house before anyone else. After a trip to the other side of the city, thought I'd try sneaking in a few caches before the 'heat' of the day. That was the plan anyway until leaving the house at 6:15AM and already having it 77degrees out!

This was the area I'd planned on beginning my caching day until passing by Indian Hill and deciding that steep hills on a HOT day sounded like a better start. [;)] After dropping 15 pounds, I was happy to see a cache almost close enough to reach from the edge of the road!

This was the sixth stop of 17 tries and 15 finds. Not bad for an oppressive humid day!

Checked one spot briefly until getting sucked into the geotrail. Came up empty there and tried a few other ideas as a train roared past just down the road. While some waiting drivers were distracted by the train, made the find and retrieval. Signed in and replaced as found.

Thanks for the nice breather!</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;This is the old Habanero cache from my peppers series that I
retired last year. Cache has been moved a bit further out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yellow trail can be muddy but is the nicest walk. the white
trail (?) that runs parallel to the canal is dry but not as
scenic.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I wanted to take my English Shepherds on a good hike, so, I decided to make a return visit to Habanero. 
It has been 5 years since I did this cache. I was curious as well, to use the Geocaching App on my Smartphone and see if it work better or worse than a GPS.

So....off we went, Eve and Asa (my Sheps) and I. A nice hike along the canal, where we met a canine hiker and exchanged a growl or two, and then down to the turn to come back to Habanero. So, I load up the Smartphone, and it takes us right to GZ with no problems. Works just as reliably as my Vista always did. Only problem being is that it costs to use (data usage) and burns the battery big time.

Found the cache, resigned the log.....and darned if my pen was still there after all these years!

On the return along the Yellow Trail, Eve decided to jump in the swamp, darn near got stuck and I thought I'd be going swimming to pull her out, but she made it back OK, finally!!! Good thing.

So, two tired dogs (one stinky and wet), a successful return to the cache and learned that the Smartphone can be used as a reliable caching GPS, at a cost.

Thanks again for a great hide. Nice to revisit.

In case anyone was wondering, approaching this one from the blue trails will provide you with a serious 100 foot bushwhack through weeds higher than your head.  Somehow we made it and then came up with the cache pretty quick.  

Thanks for placing this one out in these trails.

It is well marked, but watch for poison ivy this time of year. Found the cache with no problems and it is in good condition.  After getting the other nearby cache, I headed back by the blue trail. The rain started and the bugs were hungry (well maybe they aren't AS hunger now that I fed them). Didn't see anyone else the whole time I was out there (one and half hours).  Nice hike, but I'm sure glad it's done.</groundspeak:text>

There was absolutely NO WAY I was letting the ducks talk me out of
celebrating Halloween for the October cache and they seemed fine
with that idea.  So they have been busy designing their
costumes and are very excited to be ready for you to adopt them in
their Halloween outfits.  So be prepared for lots of
spooky and funny looking ducklings to greet you at the
cache. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#800080"&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;font&gt;Cache
is a ammo can filled with Rubber Duckies and other fun
Halloween trinkets. There is some light bushwacking the last 100
feet or so, but if you find yourself needing to wade through water,
or even crossing over a log try another approach.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 *******BIG HINT - there is a BRIDGE ... honest!! - this is a very
family friendly cache!  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font face="Comic Sans MS"
size="4"&gt;&lt;font color="#16AB31"&gt;&lt;font color="#800080"&gt;Feel free to
grab a duck to take home to celebrate this special time with you
and your family. If you don't wish to adopt a duck, please make
sure to make a note of the symbol written on the bottom of the
ducks or in the log.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 You will need to know the symbol associated with each
"Quacked-Up!" Holiday cache in order to find the bonus cache in the
series. &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;font color="#800080"&gt;You do not need a trade item to take a duck
but:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;font face="Comic Sans MS"&gt;&lt;font color="#800080"&gt;
&lt;font&gt;Please just one duck per person or caching
family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;              &lt;br /&gt;

One of my favorite Nintendo DS games was called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picross_DS"&gt;Picross&lt;/a&gt;. I spent many bleary-eyed nights sitting up in bed staring at that little screen filling in a grid. I knew to put the puzzles away when I went cross-eyed. As an homage to that game, here's a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram"&gt;nonogram&lt;/a&gt; for you to enjoy! The puzzle can be viewed a number of ways:&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Hmmmm, what can we say? We were here two weeks ago and had a DNF. After a couple emails with the CO, I assumed the cache was missing and since we were driving by, we stopped to help out the CO and confirm it. Admittedly we had a bit of a hint that helped and I had hoped that what we found would be a fresh container and log, which would have justified our DNF!  But alas, we can only say that we somehow missed this one last time. Neat puzzle and the cache is still there - albeit a bit damp and frozen into the container. A little hand warmth and hot breath got things out safely, signed and put back as found. TFTC</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I took one look at the puzzle and was instantly overwhelmed. So I jumped online to see if I could find an application that would do the work for me. Oh, I found a few, but after keying in the information several times, all I ended up with was a bunch of useless gibberish. So I set this one aside until yesterday, and was surprised to find that everything fell into place quickly. Had I only known!

Finding the actual cache wasn't a problem, but I was shocked to see where the coordinates led me. I didn't expect that! I really enjoyed your puzzle. It was a lot of fun once I actually tried it. I would encourage others to give it a try. Thanks for an excellent cache.

I have solved this kind of puzzle before and enjoyed working it so I had wanted to include it on our puzzle run today.  We enjoyed a nice stroll and got to where we needed to be, but just couldn't "spot" it.  After looking around quite a bit and trying not to attract the attention of passing dog-walkers and bikers, we resorted to a PAF who was very helpful in getting us to just the right "spot" to find the little guy.  Sneaky!  Thanks for the puzzle and the cache.  [:)]</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is placed in honor of my sister Vicki who passed away
a few years ago after a brief battle with cancer. I think of my
sister often and still can't believe she is gone. She loved kids
and was the proud mother to two beautiful daughters.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;When I first walked on this section of the Lehigh Valley Trail
last year I knew that I had to place a cache here in honor of my
sister. She really loved horses and the trail here brings you very
close by to a horse farm. On any given day you will almost
certainly see horses being ridden or grazing in the fields along
the way. She also liked to take walks with her dog and this would
have been just such a place she would go. It is abundant with
wildlife. While placing the cache with Mrs. Taz and Frogize we saw
a pair of baltimore orioles, many deer and a fox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is intended to be very kid friendly. The three
waypoints and final should all be easy to find and will hopefully
bring a smile to your face. I have rated the terrain a 2.5 only
because the total length of the hike is a little under 2 miles. The
trail is flat and very well maintained. In the summertime it's a
nice area to ride a bike or take a stroller. In the winter it is
excellent for cross country skiing. There is a bench along the way
to take a rest and watch the horses. The final is a 50 cal ammo can
that has been started off full of horse related geoswag. There is a
FTF prize for the first little one who finds the cache and a lammy
for the first "older" cacher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK1C4EP - Parking&lt;br /&gt;N 42° 59.306 W 077° 32.561&lt;br /&gt;Parking area.&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This multi gave me a hard time today.  I was trying to fit in a non-traditional cache before the rain hit so I headed over for your multi (You know when you are forced to do at least one cache each day for 20 consecutive days, you are bound to get a rainy one or two -- today was mine).  WPs1 and 2 were easy to find and relatively easy to read.  WP3 I found quickly, but as Tilley Hat mentioned in his log, the coordinates are becoming difficult to make out.  There were probably 3 separate numbers I wasn't sure on so I tried plugging in different combinations. They brought me back to an area that seemed reasonable but was way off the trail in what could have been a swampy area at other times. Plenty of possible hiding places over there, too.  I thoroughly searched the area but was coming up empty. I was ready to give up completely on finding the final, but as I was walking back to the trail, I happened to look down and spied the edge of an ammo can!!  Of course this wasn't anywhere near where the coordinate combinations I was using had led me, but I was so relieved.  And just then, the rain came down in earnest.  I quickly signed the log and ran the rest of the trail back to my car getting soaked in the process.  I highly suggest you take the time to go check on your waypoints and make sure that the numbers are clearer for future cachers.  TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;br /&gt;
Welcome to Potter Park, established in 1977. There is plenty of parking here and the park has a nice pavillion, basketball court, and playground area for kids.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We had to pick the song "Our House" by Crosby Stills &amp;amp; Nash for the name of this cache,,,it fit perfectly! The cache is large enough to hold a log book, pencil, and trackables. We also dropped a few non-trackable coins in there for anyone to take. Please take care in replacing the cache back in its original location.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For the FTF we have left a $2 bill&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Congratulations to zekechili on his First to Find!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Click To Rate This Cache&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update 3/15/08: Each waypoint used to represent a spot in the
Adirondacks. It was difficult keeping the sheets at each point dry
and clean, so now this is just a regular multicache. All the
waypoints except the final are clear plastic tubes. The final is a
50cal ammo box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our family enjoys the Adirondacksin all seasons of the year and
we normally go visit in winter and summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache was designed to be accessible in all seasons, meaning
everything is off the ground so the snow can't cover it (depending
on depth of course!). But be careful, especially on the final cache
- the hills are steep and can get slippery when wet/snowy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the micros and the final cache should be fairly easy to
find. The only difficult part about this cache is the terrain - it
is very hilly, and probably is not appropriate for the little
ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to keep to the theme, or trade anything else you
want.&lt;/p&gt;

BrotherTim and I were here this morning for another cache, but we were just too close to this one to pass it up.  He had already done it, but he was kind enough to walk along with me as I worked my way through the WPs.

The 1st fell relatively quickly, even though my GPS didn't like the area it found itself in.  The 2nd WP put up a fight (one pine tree is bad enough, but multiple pine trees?  Ugh!), but eventually victory was mine.  The rest went smoothly and I found myself facing the prize sooner than I expected.  Love the hide on this one!  I've had this cache on my to-do list for quite a while, so needless to say it felt great to finally get my name in the logbook.

Thanks for the mid-morning workout, the fun and for keeping this one going for all these years!  Great old school cache!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was my third attempt at this cache.  For the first attempt I was a bit of a newbie and struck out at the first waypoint.  I"m not sure I knew that this was a multi then.  So naive.  The second attempt was with DT4 back on the day when WTH #5 was published.  We DNF'd here as all I found was a string but no wp.  This time I had to go back to WP1 found that quickly, hoofed up to wp 2 and found that quickly, then was on to the rest of my journey.  I somehow thought I was in for a much longer hike but was pleasantly surprised to get this one done in less than 30 minutes.  There were some nice trails back there.  To bad my adirondack journey didn't take me on them for very long!  Glad to have this one completed.  Everything is in good shape.  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color="black" size="2"&gt;We all remember this game. Use
the BB Gun and just shoot the red star out of the paper. After you
empty the BB Gun the gentleman behind the counter would pull out a
400X magnifying glass and find the microscopic piece of red still
on the paper...You Lose! Well, we are going to see how well you
shoot. Once you get to the first way point you are going to have 6
shots to 'shoot the star out'. Don't worry, I won't be pulling out
a magnifying glass. Although I have heard a rumor that the targets
may move occasionally. PLEASE hide the final as you find it. This
one took a lot of time and I want everyone to enjoy the
fun.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

A HUGE 'thank you' goes out to Sapience Trek on this one. I have
changed the cache a number of times to get it just right. I am very
happy how it turned out and very thankful for the patience of ST as
I moved way points around. I think everyone will also want to put a
thanks out to DeltaDelta who encouraged me to bag the idea of
projections. This one should give you a challenge just the way it

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">So I was just checking things in a kind of 'cache-maintenance' way for CO, yeah, that's it.  That's my story &amp; I'm sticking to it.  Moving on to the REST of the story...
So I had looked at this cache as a good way to get a good hiking workout in today, and I knew a BT cache would deliver, so this cache was my main focus today in this park.  I climbed quickly up the hill and located what I thought HAD to be the start.  Good news-it was.  Bad news-I still suck at anything resembling a puzzle.  I was there a good 25-30 min wondering what came next, until I tried something, and voila-I'm off and running! (If you're like me and your vision from about 0-5 ft. stinks, bring your cheaters on this one.)  I had no real idea what to expect next, but got to the next WP, and thought I was off in good form.  Texted CO to check on something, as I couldn't read it clearly, and he graciously got me going again, in spite of my other vision issue.  Found some interesting things along the way to the following WP's: a ground hive of bees, a VERY large black dog that initially looked VERY angry but was quickly licking my hand, several like-new Nike golf balls from the nearby golf course (to hit a ball in this far OB would mean there a LOT of golfers out there even worse at golf than I am), lots of newts (I got better...) salamanders, snails, and other like creatures out enjoying the rain today.  Eventually (with a LOT of help) I located a couple of possibilities for GZ, and soon after I was signing in.  Tony Montana came to mind (as opposed to 'yahtzee' or 'huckle'...) as I found the very clever container.  This was everything I hoped for an more, and I highly recommend this cache to anyone looking for a good mental and physical challenge, but not too over the top in either way.  I'd give this one at least 2 favorite points if I could (one for each pretty tired leg), but definitely a favorite for me!  Thanks to CO for all of the time, thought and effort in setting up what is a most excellent cache!</groundspeak:text>

I was able to get two shots off, but then ran out of ammo (and time), so I'll have to come back another time. I bushwacked to the posted coordinates, but then found a nice trail out.

Took a hint from the CO to figure out what the heck I was supposed to do with the info at WP1.  But once I cleared that up I was off an running.  Took me only 4 shots to get the information i needed and headed off to the fully stocked ammo can!! Found it and had to laugh.  Thanks thinking outside the box on this multi!! Very cool!!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Greetings!

I noticed that your cache has the needs maintenance attribute set.  This is generally caused when a cacher posts a "needs maintenance log on  your cache for a number of reasons.  If you have addressed the issue or believe there is no issue, you can remove this attribute by posting an "owner maintenance" log, or editing the attribute list to remove it (note on caches other than traditional, the needs maintenance icon does not show, but clicking "Update Attributes" will clear it anyway.)

Often people will filter out caches that require maintenance so making sure this is correct will help cachers find your cache.

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Located in Powder Mills Park, the coordinates listed are for the
park's Fish Hatchery which is the starting point for this cache.
There is a parking lot right at the coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is named after the children's game of Chutes and
Ladders because you can find the final cache by either taking a
shortcut (aka climbing a ladder) or going the long way (aka sliding
down a chute).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the signs and other items around the Fish Hatchery to solve
one of the puzzles below. The Fish Hatchery closes at dusk and the
park closes at 11pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;PUZZLE #1 -- LADDER -- Offset to the Final Cache&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your GPS unit supports the ability to project a waypoint and
you feel like doing so, then solve this puzzle to get the bearing
and distance to the final cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A = The number of double concrete bays the fish are kept in,
plus 1.&lt;br&gt;
B = The sum of the digits of the speed limit on the roads that
border the Fish Hatchery.&lt;br&gt;
C = The number of fish food vending machines on &lt;b&gt;this&lt;/b&gt; side of
the road only, plus 1.&lt;br&gt;
D = The number of letters in the first name of the person who
donated the Rose of Sharon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bearing = 1AB degrees&lt;br&gt;
Distance = 0.CD miles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My GPS unit was set to use &lt;b&gt;True North&lt;/b&gt;. I projected the
waypoint while standing in the parking lot at the coordinates
listed for this cache which is directly in front of the sign that
states the name of the Foundation that funds the Fish Hatchery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;PUZZLE #2 -- CHUTE -- Coordinates to an Intermediate
Stage&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your GPS unit does not support the ability to project a
waypoint or you don't feel like doing so or you can't find the
final cache using your projected waypoint, then solve this puzzle
to get the coordinates to an intermediate stage that contains the
coordinates for the final cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; Finding this intermediate stage &lt;b&gt;IS&lt;/b&gt; more
difficult than finding the final cache container, but that's the
point of the "chute". &lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Recently (Mar 4, 2006) a
cache seeker found a mushroom nearby that had coordinates written
on it that led to private property 15 miles away. This is not part
of this cache. All parts of this cache are inside Powder Mills
Park.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A = Number of letters of the first name of the person the Rose
of Sharon is in honor of.&lt;br&gt;
B = The number of things regular feeding of the waterfowl can
cause. (The number of check marks)&lt;br&gt;
C = The number of letters in the name of the Foundation that funds
the Fish Hatchery.&lt;br&gt;
D = The number of 18-foot tall duck statues at the Fish
Hatchery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N = 43 02.7AB&lt;br&gt;
W = 77 28.7CD&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">My friend, sunnysara14, and I decided to try this one. We were fairly certain that we got the puzzle solved correctly, figured out how to project a waypoint, and off we went. Well we didn't find it so we walked back to the hatchery only to notice that there were two identical signs for the hatchery and decided to project from the other one. Got to GZ and searched for a while and came up with the smiley.</groundspeak:text>

I solved this a long while ago (using the ladder approach), but never found myself in the right place at the right time. Today proved to be the day and we enjoyed a nice walk from nearby parking to the cache. I checked a likely spot and came up empty. Gravy searched a little further away and let out an excited "Huckle Buckle". We made some trades and left a "snake egg". Thanks for the puzzle and thanks for the hide!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">FINALLY! This was at least my third attempt at this cache. I dnfed twice going the chutes way, the second time with confirmed cords and a clue. I was in the area a few months ago and got the info for the ladders way. I now have an app on my phone to project waypoints. I didnt have time that day, but I did have the final cords. I made my way to GZ and . . . Nothing. I was so bummed. Then, a little jump in my GPS gave me new home. YES! It gave me such a rush to finally get the cache after DNFing 2 years ago.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This one has been on my list for quite a while, but it wasn't one of the caches I had targeted for this morning's run.  I was on my way to another cache when I realized I was close to the first stop, so I took a quick detour.  I'm glad I did!  I used "the ladder" method and had no problem gathering up the needed info.  I was able to park close to the final, and it wasn't long before I had the nicely hidden cache in hand.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I unexpectedly found myself with some free time on this sweltering evening &amp; after wandering aimlessly for a while, found myself in Powdermill Park. I'd attempted to start this cache in the past, but never did much past collecting some data at the hatchery - I'm not even sure that I got that stuff right.

I re-collected the information and attempted the projection using an app on my phone. It put me right in the middle of a road! I checked my numbers, saw that I was off by about 160 feet, and adjusted my projection. Into the woods! I wandered for about 10 minutes, swatting bugs &amp; starting to sweat profusely, in a very large circle. I felt a bit lost without my trusty "Grunka Lunka" (my PN-40), and was getting very annoyed by the inaccuracy of my phone. About to give up, I started to return to my car when I took a shot at one final location. And of course...well, you know how it goes.

Finally, I can cross this one off my list. TFTC.

&lt;p&gt;My definition of Kid Friendly Cache is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Less than a .2 mile hike&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kid Friendly Terrain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kid Findable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Room for toys to trade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lammy for the FTF and a Morris the Stegosaurus figure and a first kid to find lammy for the first kid to find (kid means elementary school or younger). &lt;b&gt;Please leave this prize in the cache for the first kid to come out and find the cache.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">There are many trails in this part of the park.  Some branch, some intersect and some just disappear into someone's back yard.

Trails to the cache are clean, pretty well marked.  Some elevation change will  be experienced depending on the angle of approach.  Bushwhacking is not necessary but always an option for the restless. The area is beautiful, almost makes you want to stop for a picnic.

The cache is a small plastic container with camo.  I started it out with a geo Coin and a TB.

Congrats to Cimsagro4 for FTF

And to Chilehead for the fox chase




 
 Important! Do not attempt to go straight to "Road Runner cache" the county has posted Park Boundry Markers which means you would be on private property.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Greetings!

I noticed that your cache has the needs maintenance attribute set.  This is generally caused when a cacher posts a "needs maintenance log on  your cache for a number of reasons.  If you have addressed the issue or believe there is no issue, you can remove this attribute by posting an "owner maintenance" log, or editing the attribute list to remove it (note on caches other than traditional, the needs maintenance icon does not show, but clicking "Update Attributes" will clear it anyway.)

Often people will filter out caches that require maintenance so making sure this is correct will help cachers find your cache.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We did this in 100% humidity and 87 degree heat, so it was a bit of a challenge in that sense. The trail was easy, but finding the cache was very difficult because of all the ground cover. We almost gave up, but found it just in time. The description of the box is wrong. It's a camo-covered plastic box with no lettering on the outside, so look carefully. TFTC.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I was in the area to grab a few non-traditional caches and I decided to stop for this one too. The coordinates were spot on for me. The camouflage is great, but I'm not sure how well the container will hold up to the weather. I also spotted the "HH Trading Post" at the nearby bench. I'm not sure who put that there, but it was an interesting discovery. Another interesting discovery were the two deer ticks I found when I got home. I had visited a few areas tonight, but I suspect this park is where I picked them up. Check yourself. [:)] Regardless, thanks for the hide!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Ok the "geopile" is pretty much out in the open and can be seen clear as day from the bench. I actually went to close where the orig coordinates sent me only to find tons of beer and liquor bottles. Thankfully I carry lots of trash bags and cached out about 30 bottles, old beer cans, and a fresh Dunkin coffee cup JUST from around the bench and in the brush surrounding! Sad. The plastic zip bags the log books were in were chewed by animals. Bags full of water and logs totally soaked through. The cache was full of water--a nasty mix of a happy meal toys and organic matter. I am removing what is left of this container as it is a sharp rusty shard of what used to be a nice ammo box-- really not safe to handle. Reminds me time for a tetanus shot. Will contact owner to help them replace this cache.</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="False">Favorites..Favorites...Favorites!!!
  


One of the best features is the ability to award a favorite to caches you love.  On a recent vacation we used favorites to narrow down the caches we wanted to find while we were there.  It made sense that if the locals loved them, why wouldn't we.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache is a 1.5/1.5 located in the Garnsey Road Arboretum, part of Perinton Parks.  The park is open from 8AM till dusk with parking access available on Garnesy Road.  Cache has pencil and logbook, along with room for trackables and swag.


Our rating for this cache however, is based on what must be completed in order to gain a smiley.



To claim that smiley; You need to have found the top 20 favorites within 20 miles of any starting point.  You can use anyplace you want, home, office, or vacation spot.. it really doesn’t matter.  The goal of this is about getting out &amp; finding caches that others have loved………and to acknowledge some creative CO`s. 


-If you own any of the favorites or if some are temporally disabled, substitute another favorite from 21 to 25.  If you can’t complete one for some reason or another,,,(can't make the hike, couldn't solve the puzzle)...just substitute a cache from 21 to 25.  Its likely some favorites might change over time. Numbers might fluctuate, hence the reason for the 21-25 buffer.


THINGS TO REMEMBER:

-Caches found before published date of this cache DO count.

-You can sign the cache's log before you complete the challenge but can only log it here once you have found your 20 caches in 20 miles.

-You must enclose your list as proof with your log.  Please also put your geo-name as the photo title, so we can keep track of who's who.  We have enclosed a sample list in the gallery for you to reference  




TO FIND THE CURRENT TOP 20......


-Open the "Hide &amp; Seek a Cache" page.

-In the "Seek a Cache" option enter your zip in the postal code box.

-Enter 20 in the miles box and click "GO"

-This will open a new page with 20 caches listings. Click on the "Blue Ribbon" icon on top left side. This will now list the top twenty within 20 miles.




*Congrats to:  Hale-Storm on FTF!!




**Thanks to "Calkids" for the concept of this cache.** **Thank You to "New York Admin" for their help on this getting published.**

I sure didn't expect to have to take a DNF on this one.  The coordinates took me right to an obvious spot but I didn't find anything there.  After searching for awhile, I expanded my search area to include other nearby geobeacons but struck out.  By the next time I get back to NY to visit my son I should have completed the challenge.  I sure hope I can find the container then or I will be really frustrated.</groundspeak:text>

The 20mile translated into 32.2KM for us Canadians, and I used the starting point of Limeridge Mall, which has a postal code of L9A 4X5.

This was a really cool idea for a cache. I have noticed the list changes so it will be fun to check it every now and then to see what the top 20 are as time goes by.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We started our trip from London with Norshley and gr812nv. Headed to Hamilton to pick up Bruce Iroquois. Now this is where our amazing trip begins. Our trip will take us to 14 different states then back home. Thing is we are going to do the 14 states in one day. We are not going to get just any cache but caches that are either the most favorite in each state or the oldest. Which a lot of times they are both. Some caches we will get will help us along the way for challenges. The states we will be visiting are Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Washington DC, Virginia and West Virginia. We were a little worried due to the hurricane that just hit a few days ago. For the most part it had no real effect on us except one cache that we couldn't even try for due to flooding in the area. Plus a few times where we had a hard time finding gas. Nothing like driving with just fumes lol. But we always managed to find some. I will say that the scenery at pretty well all of the caches was just amazing. We finished the three day event with 43 caches. 

We started the main reason for the trip on Sunday at 12:00 am and finished the 14 states at 11:34. Now that was a fun trip. Thanks for all the caches that we went to.</groundspeak:text>

We found this cache near Rochester after an extensive search. Almost gave up on it, but then the magic words "Found it" were uttered and we SL, TFTC. A screen shot of the twenty highest favourites within 32 km (20 mi) of my home is attached.</groundspeak:text>

This is located on our own property on a drumlin. Please approach from the south (N Creek Rd) to avoid others' private property. Look for a long driveway headed uphill through the woods, south of the waypoint (see other waypoints below). The house is *not* visible from the road.

    Please park next to the telephone pole near the front of the barn, or failing that, directly in front of the barn. Please don't park by the gate on the road to the cell tower; the cell and water tower people need to be able to get in and out at all hours.

    Please drive slowly; watch out for (and don't run over) any dogs, chickens, or guinea fowl on the way up. Feel free to stop by the house if you have any questions. (sorry, we're generally late risers)

    Cache is orange plastic; contains misc stuff.

WHILE ON PROPERTY: also look for Peak Experience #54, GCGEGW

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Happy Summer. And this was the perfect cache to do on the first day of summer. Views were excellent. We enjoyed walking on the drumlin--and had been planning on doing this cache and visiting this area for weeks, but all kinds of things interfered. Today was the day. The cache container was in good shape but the log was wet and moldy--so you likely want to check it out and put in a new one. I also made sure that the cache was not touching any poison ivy. There is quite a bit in the area. I put in a Catalan TB that wants to travel widely. And I took a small bear that I thought might be harmed by the dampness. It is tough to keep caches dry when we have extensive rain--but the plants need it. [:)] Thanks again for allowing cachers on your property. It didn't look like anyone was home today so we didn't try and visit for a bit. I also like your gargoyles very much (I am a retired English instructor who specialized in medieval literature.) I will give this one a favorite vote since you are so kind to allow us to visit your drumlin. Also--we tasted a few cherries from your cherry trees--tart and delicious.</groundspeak:text>

Took the dogs with us on leash in case we spotted any pets until we got well past the gate. The walk in has a great view. The bugs were not bad and we had the cache in hand in seconds. It does need a new log book again, I think the seal is shot. Thanks for the fun afternoon we had a great time.</groundspeak:text>

Chain across main Entrance for Winter.   Longer walk, but I would wait untill spring to do this one.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Located in Swifts Landing just east of Palmyra.  Park has a boat launch for small paddle boats, grills, play areas and fishing spots.  The new Canal Trail runs threw it and is where this series is located.  To do all three of this series and two other caches placed is about one and a half miles round trip. Bicycles can be used, but some hides are alittle off the trail. All hides are winter friendly, but large accumulations of snow may hinder finding the caches.  Caches are pill containers, Lock/locks, and decons.
  There are a series of letters in the caches.  Be sure to note them as there is a decoder page in one of the caches.  It will lead you to a 50 Cal ammo box final.  
  Although this is family friendly, there may still be thorns and wet spots and minor bushwacking involved.  There is no need to go near the canal or any real dangerous spots in your hunt.  
  Please be descrete in you hunt.  Becareful not to too noticeable or obvious.  Blend in if you can with a trash bag, camera, or a dog. 
  I placed this so I can teach my grandchildren the art of geo-caching.  Please feel free to use this for the same reason.  Promoting geocaching!!!</groundspeak:long_description>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Cache is located in a small park (hours: 8 to dusk). There some elevation to the cache, and some light scrub to climb through/over.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Cache container is a one gallon mayonnaise jar, that is painted camouflage. Cache contains a log book, and some trinkets such as a compass/digital clock, big eraser, and a book (Close Encounters Of The Third Kind). There is not alot of space in the container, and the mouth of the jar is not large (maybe 3 1/2 - 4 inches), so think small. Update 7/13/2012: My airedale terrier Issaquah Puppy passed away today from cancer. She was an avid geocacher and had visited over 100 caches at a time when that was still a challenge and few people in New State had hit that mark. Please give her a thought when you visit her caches. Thank you.</groundspeak:long_description>
    <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Cache is hidden under a small fallen tree, and some brush.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

St Paddy's Day stuff is great, anything green is cool, but any trade is just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Travel bugs and coins always welcome! Bring the family, kids will especially like the holiday caches (and the ducks).&lt;br /&gt;Cache is winter accessible as long as there isn't a ton of snow and may require a small amount of bushwacking&lt;br /&gt; in warmer months. Have fun!&lt;br /&gt;**** Note - at this time there are no more ducks for this cache but keep it on your watch list as you never know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   Congrats to Hutch48 for the FTF - must be some Irish luck in you someplace!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I have had my eye on this cache for some time. Today I was in the area and had a little time.  After being swamped on one of the southern caches in this area I decided to try this one.

I looked...and looked...and looked.  I finally broke down and used a PAF.  Talk about hidden in plain sight. I really thought I looked there....

This was really well hidden.  There are sooo many places it could be. Very challenging and fun.

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This will take you to a part of Powder Mills Park that has many well marked trails to hike on. There are others that are not used as often but they still make for an nice walk to see different types of terrain, wildlife and scenery. The various trails have a  good selection of range of difficulty so there is always one to select for you to hike depending upon your ability. This cache can be reached by several ways so enjoy the hike. While placing the cache in the morning, there was a herd of about ten to twelve deer on the old ski slope.  
  The cache is a  four by four lock and lock with a $2 bill for the FTF.


Congratulations to TazD for the FTF

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">I hope your bikes are in working order, because that is the intended mode of transportation for this series. Between Palmyra and Newark there are 12 colored bison tubes placed along the Erie Canal Trail. Each cache will count as a separate smiley, so be sure to sign each log. On six of the bison tubes there is a metal tag with a letter and a number. Make note of this information, as it will be needed to find the final in the series: “Erie Canalside Bike Ride: Grand Finale”. The caches containing this information will not be designated on the cache pages, so you must find all 12 micros to get the final. Please do not mention anything about getting needed information in your logs, or they will be deleted. Not knowing which caches have final coord information is part of the fun (for me anyway)! The series is about 17 miles round trip, assuming you start at the posted parking coordinates. The terrain rating on the caches will get higher the further they are from the parking coordinates, because this series is meant to be done in one trip. Happy pedaling!</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">To finish up the 31 Days of Geocaching, we figured to take an evening trip to attempt the Erie Canalside Bike Ride series.

We didn't park at the given parking coords, as it was after dark. Instead, we parked down the road and road our bikes to the path. We left the truck shortly after 9pm and returned to the truck near 1am. 

Found #2, DNF'd #3 and found #4!  Found without much problem, luckily.  It was raining off and on, so another find lifted our spirits.  Unfortunately, the log was soaked.  We were able to very carefully write "AUTHORIZED U" before the log ripped.  So, in short, the log needs replacing.

The rain finally stopped and we were thinking about our odds with the trail, the current time, and our schedule for the next day.  We decided to ride all the way to #12 to leave some to find when we come  back to reverse our DNF at #3.  Off to #12...!  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">On this beautiful day--after doing the two drumlin caches--we decided to go to the canal and take a walk and do some of the bike caches. (Obviously we were not going to do all of them at one time--we don't own bikes at the moment--even though we used to do a lot of cycling at one time when we lived in Alabama.) This was the first bike cache that we did today--ended up doing four of them--and had a very nice walk on the canal too. Thanks for this one.</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">I hope your bikes are in working order, because that is the intended mode of transportation for this series. Between Palmyra and Newark there are 12 colored bison tubes placed along the Erie Canal Trail. Each cache will count as a separate smiley, so be sure to sign each log. On six of the bison tubes there is a metal tag with a letter and a number. Make note of this information, as it will be needed to find the final in the series: “Erie Canalside Bike Ride: Grand Finale”. The caches containing this information will not be designated on the cache pages, so you must find all 12 micros to get the final. Please do not mention anything about getting needed information in your logs, or they will be deleted. Not knowing which caches have final coord information is part of the fun (for me anyway)! The series is about 17 miles round trip, assuming you start at the posted parking coordinates. The terrain rating on the caches will get higher the further they are from the parking coordinates, because this series is meant to be done in one trip. Happy pedaling!</groundspeak:long_description>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Well, it's happened the M&amp;M Family is causing problems.  The newly discovered kids were looking for parents or relatives.  They heard that the M&amp;M Babe Impostor would not come near them so they took a cache box and ran away with it.  It had a log book, for you to record your visit; a camera (take your picture put it back in box); playing cards and the other usual trinkets for you to trade.  If you find the kids please try to unite them for a while at least with the M&amp;M Dude and/or the M&amp;M Babe.  If you want to be nasty, make the M&amp;M Imposter Babe meet them whether she likes it or not.  They do have an M&amp;M (Mushroom Man) babysitter that should remain with them for their own safty.  You can't trust them to stay put.  Good Luck finding them!  They do attract mosquitos so be prepared.</groundspeak:long_description>

I managed to evade the mosquitoes for most of the walk in, but the moment I stood still at the cache to sign the log, they started swarming me in earnest.  I got out of there as quickly as I could.

I did not see any trackables in there (although I may not have noticed from swatting at skeeters), and the log book is getting pretty full.

It's always a pleasure to run into you, Donner Party, while
searching out caches and here's to celebrating your 1000+++

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Foursum has done over 1,000 finds mostly with his wife keikis faster than just about anyone I know.  This cache is to honor his achievement.  CONGRATULATIONS!!
 
Foursum is a very knowledgeable and accomplished boater. He is a member of the United States Power Squadron and hold the title of Senior Navigator. It is the hardest rank to complete. He is a Past Commander of our squadron (Iroquois Sail and Power Squadron). He also holds the title of  the head District 6  Vessel Safety Examiner.   He oversees all the vessel examiners in District 6 and he personally has inspected over 1,000 boats since he started.  He has earned many honors with his commitment to this worthy cause.  He has qualified to be well within the top ten Squadron examiners nationwide several years in a row.
 
 
This cache will require knowledge of GPS, terminology , and minor skills of hardware found on most boats. You will need to know to project a waypoint. using a "back Azimuth" to locate the final.  Once at GZ you figure out how to retrieve it. GZ can be delicate.  If something comes loose or gets knocked, please replace.   Return container to original location please!!
 
Difficulty is rated on the knowledge and GPS level..  Terrain is rated on the retrieval only.     D=3.5  T=3.5
 
Once you locate Waypoint one you will see a degree and footage note.  From where you are project a waypoint using a "back Azimuth" method.  The cords listed are for parking nearby and waypoint one.   Enjoy and please be respectful of the this beautiful trail system.
This is part of the Ontario Pathways  Trail System

Congradulations to Foursum and keikis for the first and second to find!  ( As it should be!)

At first, since I didn't know what a reverse asimuth was, I just projected a waypoint the way I normally do, and quickly found out that was not the way to go. I then did a little researh and tried again. That brought me to a good looking area, but after some bushwhacking, I still needed to call the CO for help. He confirmed I had correctly found GZ and with the one queston he asked me, the lightbulb went off. I had looked right at it previously but did not see it. Soon I was signing the log after admiring the craftmanship. A very unique arrangement, earning a favorite point from me. Thanks for the fun!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I spent a fair amount of one at wp1 and came away empty. So I went ahead and found another cache on the trail and then come back. I found wp1 this time and scratched my head about getting to wp2. I had my compass with me and shot the bearing as indicated but couldn't remember just how to do it the way it was indicated on the writeup so I found another way to approach it and soon had myself at gz. I had a hunch but wasn't ready to follow through on it so I texted the CO and confirmed my hunch. I got into position to see the cache and knew immediately that I wasn't prepared to go after this one today.  I saw it clear as day, but will take the DNF until I can get back this summer.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Wow. Captain Jon's done it again. I picked up the information at the posted coords this summer, but was unable to figure out where the cache itself was. Driving through the area today, I decided to take advantage of the fall conditions &amp; take another crack at it. When I pulled into the parking area there was a large horse trailer there and I started wondering if I'd have to explain myself to some equestrians.

I followed the horse tracks to the same area I found this summer &amp; headed into the weeds. I checked and re-checked everything I'd looked at before. Luckily it wasn't quite as thick as it was 3 months ago. I re-emerged on the trail wondering what to do next. I read and re-read the logs I had stored in the GPS, and got to thinking more carefully about the email Captain Jon sent after my DNF (well, what I could remember of it). I returned to the place the GPS was showing me and thought a bit more.

Then I fished out another tool I'd brought along and tried using it in some unorthodox ways. Lo and behold, I spotted what needed to be spotted. A few minutes of physical effort and I had the cache in hand. A few more and it was back where it belonged and I was on my way.

I wish I had half the creativity (with a dash of evil) that Captain Jon has. Outstanding hide!</groundspeak:text>

I was very happy to get a nod in the puzzle. [:)] Today, I dropped my daughter off at play rehearsal and then made a run of non-traditional caches in the area for a challenge. I came around the back way to this and found suitable parking. On the trail, I stopped to check my phone and was soon surprised by a trail runner. After that, I had the trail to myself. I searched a bit, but finally spotted the cache. When I got home later in the night, I found two ticks on me (one biting and one crawling).

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Greetings!

I noticed that your cache has the needs maintenance attribute set.  This is generally caused when a cacher posts a "needs maintenance log on  your cache for a number of reasons.  If you have addressed the issue or believe there is no issue, you can remove this attribute by posting an "owner maintenance" log, or editing the attribute list to remove it (note on caches other than traditional, the needs maintenance icon does not show, but clicking "Update Attributes" will clear it anyway.)

Often people will filter out caches that require maintenance so making sure this is correct will help cachers find your cache.

If you haven't addressed the issue, go out and find a few caches and fix this one on the way back!  [:)]

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">What a beautiful afternoon it turned out to be today! After spending the morning and early afternoon golfing with my grandfather, the day only got better when I saw the skies had cleared and our timing left me with bonus time for stretching my legs before needing to return home.

Ended up nearby and thought I'd take a walk to finally wrap up this cache. Seems like the final coordinates have been sitting in my GPSr for way too long!

Enjoyed the peaceful walk. The birds were out enjoying the warmth and sun as well. I was serenaded to an from the cache.

Did a circle around where my GPSr led me. Struck out in my favorite spot to search and was fortunate to collect myself just feet from the cache. As I formulated my next plan of attack the container caught the corner of my eye. Sweet!

Everything appeared great until I started to unroll the bag containing the log. I'm not sure how the container could be dry but the baggie soaked?! I was woefully unprepared to replace the log. [:(] Was able to sign in but hope the next cacher or two arrives with some dry paper they can swap out with what is at the final.

Thanks for the puzzle and the hike!</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The cache is a clear plastic 2 quart container with a screw lid. It contains many things, large and small, that contain the word "ROUND" in their description. TB "Baja Buggy" placed here for TFTF, for instance, has ROUND wheels. Please continue the theme by exchanging something ROUND for something you take. There's no doubt that you have SOMETHING round on you!

The cache is located along a public hiking trail, but PLEASE respect the rights of private landowners by NOT leaving the trail by more than 20 to 30 feet! If you have a VERY sharp eye, you'll see the container without touching anything! Please return it to the EXACT same location after your find. The trip is easiest if you start from a HIGH elevation and move lower, but you'll walk more that a mile regardless. In fact, the HIGH elevation start is the 2nd highest in the Finger Lakes! Return to the start, or continue along. There are 3 other caches near the start, and two more along the trail after "Get Around". This cache CAN be located in the winter by snowshoers or cross country skiers.

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">A multi-staged cache. There is a pen in the final, but bring your
own just in case.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Coords are to the first stage of this “multi” cache and it is a …..
You guessed it, a SMALL magnetic NANO button. Use the provided
parking coords for ease of starting this cache. This should be a
fun trip…… each container gets a little bigger until you reach the
final of an AMMO BOX. The notes in the cache container tell you
what the next stage is and it’s coords.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
There is a GeoCoin “seeded” in one of the stages and there is a
“Green” Jeep TB in the final. Once I see the cache is published I
will do the actual "web based" drop of these trackables so they
show up.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
There are 12 cammoed small containers all set up with logs,
replacement log package, FTF prize of a “Golden” SAC $1 coin. Some
are magnetic and some are not. If you take one please let me know
and I will watch for you to hide and post it (hopefully in a NEAR
by area so I can find it too) so I can add the link to this page
for others to see easier. I spent quite a while preparing these and
hope to FIND them again someday.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
There are some trade items in the ammo box. Please be kind to your
fellow cachers and trade fairly.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
There is a FTF prize of an unactivated Micro-Mini GeoCoin in the
One Zip bag the log is in and it is in the final.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Congrats to Peppermill 6-Pack on their FTF it is their 150th FTF
on this site&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The rest of the WPs were intertwined throughout our morning hike as we weaved our way along the trails grabbing other caches.  The morning came full circle as this was the last cache I grabbed on the way back to the car.

Great idea for a multi, and nicely executed.  Thanks for putting this one out there and thanks to the other cacher who performed maintenance for you while you were unable to do so.  (Hope you're doing better!)  Thanks for the fun!</groundspeak:text>

You get a favorite point for completely pulling one over on me, it was like a good magic trick.  Thanks for a great hide!

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is part of the Erie Canal orginal canal path.  In the early days, this was the path the animals used to pull boats by ropes.    Part of a series in this area leading to a 50 Cal ammo can.  Please note the letters in cache.  In one of the caches in this series is a decoder that when matched up with the proper numbers/letters will lead to the bonus find.  This cache is a decon that has room for small trade items.  I have placed a few Where's George Dollars and coins for the FTF's in this series.  PLEASE replace just you found it. Be descrete in your travels!  Good area to learn about geocaching and how to locate and find and rehide caches without being noticed.  
  this cache is winter friendly, but when placed the was ice on the main trail.  please watch you step! 
  Also take time to enjoy this beautiful area.</groundspeak:long_description>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to Voak Cemetery.  I stumble upon this place a few summers ago when my wife and I were doing genealogy research is a cemetery down the road.  An old country cemetery like this is always a peaceful place to visit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is now an association cemetery, well maintained and still used for burials today. For more than a century it has served the settlement of Voak, once centered on the Methodist church and public school located at the crossroads. The cemetery may have gotten its start as a burial ground for the numerous Voak families, but soon was used by many other families in the area.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please only search for this cache during daylight times.  The cache is not located on or near any stones.  My 7 year old daughter hid this one all by herself.  It shouldn’t be too difficult.&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is located on our own property on a drumlin. Please approach from the south (N Creek Rd) to avoid others' private property. Look for a long driveway headed uphill through the woods, south of the waypoint (see additional waypoints below). The house is *not* visible from the road.

It's fairly easy to get most of the way there, but the last trail is a bit overgrown in spots and may still have some branches down in the way (easy to get around).

Please park next to the telephone pole near the barn (or, failing that, in front of the barn). Please don't park by the gate on the road to the cell tower; the cell and water tower people need to be able to get in and out at all hours.

Please drive slowly; watch out for (and don't run over) any dogs, chickens, or guinea fowl on the way up. Feel free to stop by the house if you have any questions.

Cache is orange plastic; contains mostly small toys.

WHILE ON PROPERTY: Also look for Drumlin View, GCGH6T

NOTE: To those looking for the Grinch TB: the last mention of it I saw was on July 15, 2003 over here: http://www.navicache.com/cgi-bin/db/displaycache2.pl?CacheID=1831

I emailed them once or twice and never got a response. :(

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Thanks again for letting us explore your drumlin. Found the cache with no trouble--and again it was very wet inside--but this time I could sign the log. Dumped out the water and tried to dry the cache as much as possible. Everything in bags were fine but things outside of bags were getting water ruined, so I'd check on this one. Summer wildflowers were abundant on the trails and it was a lovely day. Took a little troll that I feared might become water damaged.</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">This cache is placed in Powder Mills Park and will give you many
trails to select from for hiking and seeing the various wildlife
and plants that are in this habitat.&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Did you ever wonder where words or phrases originated? Today we
have instant access to answer some of those things. Working a
graveyard shift is an experience that only those who worked it know
what it feels like. It is also commonly called the night shift.
Where did that term originate? Just some answers to a couple of
phrases that are well known.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
People would be buried with a rope leading from inside the coffin
to a bell above the ground. This enabled anyone who was buried
alive to ring the bell and to draw attention to the mistake. Since
people would not expect to see their 'dead' loved ones again, a
person resembling the deceased is a 'dead ringer'. This is also
reputed to be the origin of the expression 'graveyard shift'
because people from the village used to take it in turns to listen
for the bell.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This will take you to a part of Powder Mills Park that has many
well marked trails to hike on. There are others that are not used
as often but they still make for an nice walk to see different
types of terrain, wildlife and scenery. The various trails have a
good selection of range of difficulty so there is always one to
select for you to hike depending upon your ability. This cache can
be reached by several ways so enjoy the trail you take and enjoy
the hike.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The terrain rating for this is due to the length and a few hills to
get to the cache if you use the caches waypoints. It is a narrow
trail but has great overlooks of the creek that flows through the
park.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please bring your own pencil or pen. The FTF will get a gold one
dollar coin.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Congratulations to Wheelygood for being the FTF !!!

(The cache is not hidden near the chimney area, so there is no need to pick it apart.) There is also a letterbox near here.

Small container with no room for trackables. Bring your own pen.

There is a trailhead close by, but parking is difficult on this busy road.  You could also park down the road at the fish hatchery parking lot and pick up the other trailhead there. It’s a nice walk along the wooded hillside. And you can stop to see the fish, too.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">An early morning errand got me out of the house before anyone else. After a trip to the other side of the city, thought I'd try sneaking in a few caches before the 'heat' of the day. That was the plan anyway until leaving the house at 6:15AM and already having it 77degrees out!

This was the area I'd planned on beginning my caching day until passing by Indian Hill and deciding that steep hills on a HOT day sounded like a better start. [;)] After dropping 15 pounds, I was happy to see a cache almost close enough to reach from the edge of the road!

This was the seventh stop of 17 tries and 15 finds. Not bad for an oppressive humid day!

Didn't realize the history here. Took a moment to take in the plaque and think about the neighboring soles and what they accomplished with their project.

Had my GPSr lead me astray once I returned to caching. Got sucked in to where it took me and went back and forth twice before spotting the cache somewhere else. Doh! Signed in and returned to the comfort of the van's AC.</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">A straightforward four (4) part multi-cache located on the famous Erie Canal. The final is a matchstick container tucked away in a secluded natural area. You should not have to leave your kayak to locate the wps or sign the final. Coordinates are provided for a public launch where we started from, granted they are long way from the starting way point so you might want to find an alternate launch. 

Bring your own writing instrument, the log is water proof paper, gel pens work the best. 

At the time of placement winter accessibility  is unknown. Snowfall should not keep you from finding all parts, however there is the possibility of poor ice conditionst. I believe there is the potential for a good found it in the winter story.

I've been wanting to get this found for years, almost got it last summer but then the morning we had it planned, 101 battleships got published and we got kinda distracted.  Today, nothing got in our way, well, except trees.  Lots and lots of trees.  We also saw plenty of wildlife, Herons, king fisher, and turtles, big turtles.  This was a great adventure, and I'm glad to have it done, even though it's not my closest to home anymore.  Now about that bike tour....</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Welp this was an real adventure. S4C and I went and piked u his father's canoe from the southern tier last week with the idea of taking this one on. Today was sunny so we decided to go for it even if it wasn;t a Sunday.

We had an idea where WP1 might be and we were right. The second waypoint didn't follow suit though and we knew we were in for a Wheelygood cache. We found it and the third waypoint with no great difficulty (other than the paddle to get there) but the final was something else. 

The water was low and the number of downed trees were high, so maneuvering our canoe around them was quite a challenge. Sometime we powered over them. Other times, we had to perfect the art of turning a canoe on a dime. We finally reached a spot about 600 feet from the final where we couldn't paddle any father due to downed trees, so we decided to go for it on foot. We got within 70' and were denied by water too deep to wade across. We made our way back to the canoe and figured out a solution to our problem.  Soon we had our canoe near the cache but we had to practice our limbo skills as well as the art of lifting a canoe over submerged trees while you are sitting in it. No easy task! We felt like we were in the Amazon jungle for much of our way to the final.

We finally spotted the prize right in front of us and were VERY glad to sign the log. All the waypoints (including the final) were in pristine condition. 

All in all, we paddled nine miles and because of the complication at the final, it took us five hours to complete.  This one gets a favorite point from me for being an epic cache. I'll remember doing this one a long time</groundspeak:text>

Two Great Blue Herons, a few Kingfishers, dozens of turtles and carp and even an Osprey!!  Thanks for the nicely done cache!!  ps... I didn't have a pen so I scratched my name in the log with a wire... it worked well!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">So firstly...
I believe the reptile BT saw (we saw him too, but with a friend...) was a 'canalocroc'.  I believe that they are native to this portion of the canal, and are the natural enemy of the allicanal - but it's possible I have that backwards.

Moving on... what an AWESOME cache!!!  I had my son with me today, and he led most of the way (he's a LOT more flexible than I am...).  I will say that after finding WP3, with our spectators rooting us on most of the way, that we made this last part a LOT harder than it had to be. (Hey Wheely, can we get credit for making this a 6 star?...)  Suffice to say, there is a right and wrong (which we found) way to get to the final.  In fact, after about 35 minutes of the wrong way, we were ready to give up, but kind of ran into the right way by accident, so the chase was back on (neither of us were REALLY ready for the dnf anyway...).  Before we knew it we w/in feet and signing the log.  I'd like to say my limbo skills improved today, but that would be a big fat hairy lie.  My son &amp; I are both decent kayakers, but I would definitely concur that this cache was an excellent test and made better paddlers out of both of us.  Thanks Wheely for a great cache, &amp; I would also encourage other paddlers out there to give this one a try!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I have been wanting o do this one for some time - it's a Wheelygood cache and it's lonely.

The other day I scoped out the area looking for a place to put in close by so I could do this before work. I found a great spot that turned out to be very close and very easy. 

Today I headed out early and got to the spot I picked out to launch from. It worked better than I thought it would. As I paddled the canal it didn't take long to realize where I was going along I passed very close by to am alligator, but it may have been a croc. A little further along I passed a heron that was very close by, it didn't seem to bothered by me passing by. Finally made it to where I needed to be and yep, there was the first WP and it was in great shape.

Off to WP2. This was also a fun time, I had hundreds of bikers pass me and wave. Apparently about 500 folks started from Buffalo and were headed to Albany.  Got to where I need to be and had some fun with this one. Good thing I am flexible!  This was also in great shape.

WP3 - I had figured I would end up here knowing Wheely. He sure didn't disappoint! While grabbing this tag I spotted some turtles, a heron and other various birds and jumping fish.  lots of water bugs too! After I grabbed the cords and was moving to the final I wondered if I would see any deer. To my surprise I spotted something in a wooded area. It looked a bit big, then I realized someones cow had wandered and was poking around in the woods! You never know what you are going to see.

The final. hmm, don't want to give anything away but I really had to work to get it. I have been kayaking for awhile, but after today I am even more comfortable with what I can do in my boat. I did not think I was going to make it to GZ, but I didn't let anything stop me!  A local resident has been busy and he made the way a bit difficult. In the end, being stubborn paid off. After starting at 9:20 I had the cache in hand by 10:36!  

After that, I was able to make my way to the car without to much difficulty. I was able to get out and stay dry to my surprise.

This is a fantastic paddle cache. I almost think this could be my favorite paddle cache of all. I would strongly encourage and challenge anyone who kayaks or can get their hands on one to go after this cache...you will not be disappointed! This was a great way to start the morning.

Thanks Wheely for a great time, a great cache and a whole lot of fun. It was a perfect day to go for this one. I really hope this cache sees some activity.  All the WP's are in great shape, they are all asy to find and the final make the adventure complete.

Also, one more Wheelygood cache that's lonely no more!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">First of two paddle caches for the day. I have Been meaning to do this one before they drain the canal.  After talking with the CO I was inspired to get off the couch watching football and enjoy this great fall day. I assumed I was in for a boring flat Canal paddle. Boy was I wrong.  The cache took me into a really neat area that I had fun exploring.  As I got a few hundred feet from the final my kayak started hitting something crunchy.  The stagnant water was actually still frozen from last nights cold temps.  Turned my boat into an icebreaker and had the final in my hands in no time. Thanks for another nice hide. Can't believe more people have not found this one.</groundspeak:text>

Of course I wanted to find somewhere he hadn't been, but of course I had not, he has been nearby before kayaking.  Saw a turtle, a blue heron, other birds I have not identified yet, but people-wise it was very quiet, only a few out.  Enjoyed the final stretch and stayed dry true to your word.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Pep put out the notice that this cache was at the top of the to do list today so I loaded up the kayak before heading off to breakfast. After a nice filling meal our group gathered and put in at a nice location. We paddled for a while to waypoint 1 on this beautiful day. With the next set of coords in hand we were on our way to the second stop on so on until we reached a nice spot off the beaten trail. We did many kayak limbos as we worked our way closer and closer to the final. We all crowded in to try to make the FTF (in our group at least). We were searching for a bit when I was lucky enough to spot it and backed away to let others into the search area. Eventually we all spotted it and the cache was retrieved. With everyone signed in we made our way back out enjoying this serene spot. Thanks for the fun on a nice spring day.</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This cache is located in Trail Town USA, aka Perinton. It's located along the Crescent Trail, a 26 mile long footpath winding through wooded hills and scenic wetlands (wear boots). The cache is a 30 cal ammo box with room for small trade items.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Parking is available at N43° 03.171 W077° 27.829. There are ten caches in this series. The first nine caches each contain one of nine badges you’ll earn as you improve your outdoor skills. Once you have found them, you'll have the information you need to find the final cache and earn the Geocaching Merit Badge.

When you find this cache, note the letter and number assigned to that badge. You’ll need that information to decode the location of the final cache.

To earn the badge, answer the following questions. If you get stuck, you'll find the answers in the cache.

1.	How many feet are in a mile?
2.	The Appalachian Trail goes from __________ to ____________?
3.	What do you call the markers that show where a trail is?
4.	What do you call a pile of rocks that marks a trail?

Click on the image below to see a game card showing the nine caching badges. You can print this page and attach each badge (sticker) on top of its picture to track your progress as you complete the series. It is also a convenient place to record the badges' secret letter and number to decode the location of the final cache.

I was actually in the area looking for non-traditional caches but when I saw this one come up on the map, I figured I'd need to go look for it since I had already found another in the series earlier.  As I collected the log from the first cache I stopped for on the Crescent Trail, the rain began.  As I walked to the second cache, the lightning and thunder started and then it started POURING as I signed the log for that one.  Already wet anyways, I decided to press on and find your cache.  My glasses were fogging up and it was getting harder to see the GPS, but I made it to GZ and eventually found the cache.  Had to laugh when I found a wadded up rain poncho in the cache box (not that it would do me any good at this point!! LOL)  Signed the log and then was excited to see that there was a Travel bug in the cache.  This made the long wet slog back to the car in the creek like path all worth it.  Of course by the time I got back to the car I realized I never figured out what the number or letter for this cache were.  Oh well...  TFTC and the well earned TB.</groundspeak:text>

It didn't want to move from where I parked my car. I did a bit of walking back and forth. Then I found the sneaky hide. Well done. Cords at GZ ranged from 13' to 45'. I'm not sure why.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Solved this quite awhile ago and decided that today was the day to head east to sign some logs. Knew the area would be wet so tried to park as close as possible, but have no clue if I succeeded- I think I did.  Made a right decision about what trail to take which turned in to a wrong decision because of ground conditions. Navigated a field which was really a lake-ok- so not really- but eventually made my way to the cache location. Cache is in great shape- all that rain doesn't seem to have affected it. Signed the log, picked up the code info, replaced the container.. and returned via a more sensible route.  It was a fun puzzle and hide- thanks!</groundspeak:text>

Don't know if we missed the trail or there just isn't one, but it was a great hike just the same in a new to me area.  With a ton of good hiding spots at GZ, we split up to cover more ground.  My GPS insisted the hide was in a different spot, but after exhausting the possibilities there I wandered over toward BT.  Got lucky and just happened to look at the right place at the right time.  Two more signatures are now in the log.

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">This will take you on a short hike to a part of Powder Mills Park
that has an interesting trail that takes you near the creek. The
terrain rating is due to the way you go the cache area.&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This park once had several mills which manufactured blasting powder
used in western New York stone quarries and the coal mines in
northern Pennsylvania. Gun powder, which played an important part
in the Civil War, was also manufactured at the powder mills.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was always the danger of explosions so several mills were
built, one for each step in the process, a good distance from each
other. Wooden pegs were used in the construction to lessen the
chance of sparks which might ignite dangerous explosives. A little
wooden railroad connected the buildings and wooden wheels were used
on the flat car which carried materials from one building to
another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the trailhead you will soon be walking on a path that is
actually a dike for a mill pond once used for the race head to run
the water to turn water wheels for the mills. There is still a
moving water wheel at the parking lot. Today it is looks like a
swamp but it is a habitat for many types of wildlife and
vegetation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be looking for a camoed matchstick container. Please
bring your own pen or pencil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FTF will get a crisp rolled up one dollar bill.&lt;/p&gt;

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Back in the dark ages when I was a kid, we use to play on the sand hill above the water wheel. There was an old man living at the top of the hill in a small house.  We would play ding dong ditch-it until the parents found out... Then we had to knock on the door and apologize for causing him trouble.  As a punishment we got to deliver his groceries for 6 mos.  He was a wonderful soul.  When he passed away the Fire department had an controlled burn and reduced the house to nothing.  All that remains now are the front steps.

Just past the steps at the top of the sand hill is a lovely overlook that is breathtaking in the Fall.  Make sure you check out the view.

PLEASE USE THE TRAIL THAT GOES AROUND THE BACK SIDE... The hill is unstable, steep and climbing the steep part contributes to erosion.</groundspeak:long_description>

Click To Rate This Cache&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a tradition in some parts of the country to put out a golden ammo can when a cacher reaches 1000 finds. So this is a long overdue (or is it?) celebration of 1000 finds (?) for Wheelygood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's that you say? Yes, nobody really truly knows how many finds Wheelygood has, probably not even him. I have no idea if he has reached 1000 finds or not - Wheelygood's motto is "It's not about the numbers".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether or not he has reached this milestone, I thought it would be fun to put this out at the same time as two other golden ammo cans are being published, and celebrate all that Wheelygood has done to make this sport fun for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike others who hide golden ammo cans, I have no intention of giving the coordinates out ahead of time. This is for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wheelygood doesn't need the help to get a FTF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wheelygood wouldn't want a FTF handed to him&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm just not that nice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Please, please: Don't make this an easy FTF for Wheelygood. Rush out as soon as you see this! I know Wheely would like to run into other cachers to help him celebrate this virtual milestone.
&lt;p&gt;If you have a favorite story of Wheelygood that you could share, please post it here with your find!&lt;/p&gt;

I have had ticks on me so I know how to get them off (I was glad that we didn't see any). After making it through the jungle we got to where we needed to be. After a few circles and head scratching I spotted this one.  

Great job Wheelygood on all those caches that have been found...no one knows the number but I am sure it is up there pretty high!</groundspeak:text>

Some huge trees back in this spot, including one amazing one.  We got signed in and then headed on.  Thanks for the cache and congratulations to Wheely on his 1000+ notes!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">As I approached GZ, I was thinking about Wheely's cache "I Didn't See That Coming" - one of my all time favorites. Then I saw the HUGE tree roughly where I thought GZ would turn out to be, and thought to myself, "Self, what have you gotten yourself into now?" I figured I'd have to came back with carabiners, rope, and an EMT crew, but then rechecked the D/T rating and relaxed.  Soon the prize was in hand.  Kudos to Wheely and TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

This cache is all about the things I have run across being a plumber.  There will be a short series of these caches.   Hope you enjoy them.


This cache is located on the Ontario pathways trail system in Phelps.   Parking is at the trail head on Gifford Road.  This is the only parking for this trail.  It can be muddy at times, but usually is a comfortable walk.  

Once at GZ, treat the cache and container gently as it would be easy to ruin the set up for others.  Replace everything as found so others can enjoy the cache Please!


There is no room for trades and you will need to bring a pen/pencil with you also.  During hunting season it is recommended you wear bright colors as not to attract attention to you.  There is no hunting on the trail, but it is allowed near by.  This is a dawn to dusk trail system. 


I copied this from a cache I did near Letchworth State park and loved it.  Look for more in this series to come out soon.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">An early morning errand got me out of the house before anyone else. After a trip to the other side of the city, thought I'd try sneaking in a few caches before the 'heat' of the day. That was the plan anyway until leaving the house at 6:15AM and already having it 77degrees out!

This was the area I'd planned on beginning my caching day until passing by Indian Hill and deciding that steep hills on a HOT day sounded like a better start. [;)] After dropping 15 pounds, I was happy to see a cache almost close enough to reach from the edge of the road!

Expected this to be a quick stop. Parked nearby and got a good surprise when I reached the search area - I wasn't alone! Some four footed friends tried to tell me where to look but kept talking over one another so much so I couldn't catch the drift of where they said to focus. Tried my own spot but came up empty. Widened my search area but didn't see to many possibilities. With their encouragement, headed back to my first area and a different angle in a different spot made all the difference in the world. Signed in and headed out while listening to their chuckles.

Thanks.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Wow.  This one killed me for some reason.  I was already hot and sweaty from working all day down the street, and then jumping in and out of the air condidioned vehicle for the earlier caches. The temperature was in the low 80's, and the humidity in the upper 70's, so I was drenched. Then, I had all kinds of trouble tracking this little sucker down.  In what seems like another "Tilley Style", there were several interesting objects nearby, but they did not contain the cache.  I was just about to give up and move on, when I spotted this sneaky bugger.  Thanks ... althoug the search here ended my attempt to get all of the "He Who ..." caches!</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">I hope your bikes are in working order, because that is the intended mode of transportation for this series. Between Palmyra and Newark there are 12 colored bison tubes placed along the Erie Canal Trail. Each cache will count as a separate smiley, so be sure to sign each log. On six of the bison tubes there is a metal tag with a letter and a number. Make note of this information, as it will be needed to find the final in the series: “Erie Canalside Bike Ride: Grand Finale”. The caches containing this information will not be designated on the cache pages, so you must find all 12 micros to get the final. Please do not mention anything about getting needed information in your logs, or they will be deleted. Not knowing which caches have final coord information is part of the fun (for me anyway)! The series is about 17 miles round trip, assuming you start at the posted parking coordinates. The terrain rating on the caches will get higher the further they are from the parking coordinates, because this series is meant to be done in one trip. Happy pedaling!</groundspeak:long_description>

Happily A had a tool and after much prodding, we were able to get it for it was wedged into its spot much too tightly. I think we alleviated the situation when we put it back where it belongs. Also as with bicycle cache #7--the log was soaked and too wet to sign--sorry. This was our turn around point on the canal so we will have to do some of the other bike caches another time.

section of the Crescent Trail. Coords were averaged over 150 times,
but they still seemed a little jumpy. Again you need to bring your

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Greetings!

I noticed that your cache has the needs maintenance attribute set.  This is generally caused when a cacher posts a "needs maintenance log on  your cache for a number of reasons.  If you have addressed the issue or believe there is no issue, you can remove this attribute by posting an "owner maintenance" log, or editing the attribute list to remove it (note on caches other than traditional, the needs maintenance icon does not show, but clicking "Update Attributes" will clear it anyway.)

Often people will filter out caches that require maintenance so making sure this is correct will help cachers find your cache.

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">A quick find, easy, historical, and appropriate for the

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Cache is a midsize Lock-N-Lock. Contents include logbook, writing
utensils. Initially stocked w/ coins and other goodies, a couple
matchbox cars. FTF Prize: An unactivated Hector's Dolphin geocoin
(activation code included). Update: Stache88 gets FTF! 
&lt;p&gt;There is a square plot of grass, not very large, between Route
96 and the old pioneer cemetery, near the end of Garnsey Road. On
this lonely plot once stood a schoolhouse, the first in Bushnell’s
Basin, built circa 1812. By 1825, Bushnell’s Basin was booming with
the construction of the Erie Canal. As life gave, it also tooketh
away. Two years later the residents of the Basin found they needed
somewhere to put their dead, and the land behind the schoolhouse
was donated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cemetery is the resting place for over two hundred Perinton
residents, many of them war veterans or prominent contributors to
the local Basin community. The oldest burial there is that of
Clarissa Richardson, who died in 1827 at the age of 25. She was the
wife of Gould Richardson, who bought a tavern with his brother
Elias, both of whom are also buried here. The tavern they acquired
was built in 1818 by John Pardee, sold to John Hartwell in 1821,
resold to William Bushnell in 1823, and acquired by the Richardsons
shortly thereafter. The inn was operated as a public house for
canal workers and travelers until the 1930’s when, strangely, it
was sold to a nudist group, who remained there briefly, eventually
it was completely abandonded by the 1960’s. It was purchased and
renovated in 1978, and became what we know as Richardson’s Canal
House today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most recent gravestone is that of George Dickens, who died
in 1956. Prominent figures buried here include Amos Woodin, a
Revolutionary War veteran who died in 1842; Jared Frisbee who
fought in the War of 1812, and four graves of Civil War Veterans:
Otis Rosebrook and the three brothers George, Robert, and Captain
David Hill. Twenty-one members of the Collins family rest here,
including Harskeline Collins, who is thought to have used his Greek
Revival house on Ketchum Rd as a stop on the Underground Railroad
(now at #1041 Rt 96). Four Ketchums are buried here, they built the
farmhouse around 1850 that is now at #1433 Rt 96. Fifteen members
of the VanNess family also lie here, including the patriarchs John
and Alada who bought 107 acres in the 1820s, and whose house still
stands as a historical monument at 24 LaSalle Parkway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The McCoords lived in a 108 acre farm just north of Garnsey Road
and owned what is now Hitching Post Plaza, raising oats and rye as
well as apples that they processed in a nearby cider mill. McCoord
burials are indicative of the fragility of life. Joseph G. was
three days old when he died, Malachi was two, and Joseph F. drowned
in the Colorado River at age twenty one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cemetery can reveal family stories. Illness may take more than
one family member at a time, like Emily Collins who died in March
1835 at the age of one and her brother Hiram who died in April at
age three. Three or four members of one family may go off to the
same war like the Hall brothers. The closeness (or size) of
families is evident when fifteen or more of its members are buried
in the same cemetery. Not only are there numerous graves of
children, but there are also those of people like Louise Dickens
and John Lash who managed to survive childhood and childbirth and
disease and war to live into their nineties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carvings in the older gravestones here have a Victorian flavor,
and each has a specific meaning. In particular, you will find lots
of willow trees, which are a sign of mourning and nature’s lament.
The finger pointing to heaven is a promise of ascension and
heavenly reward, flowers the frailty of life and mortality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little imagination and bit of quiet time to reflect on the
lives of those who are buried at Bushnell’s Basin not only helps to
link the past to the present, but also makes real the stories that
are told there.&lt;br&gt;

Thanks so much for taking the trouble to find out about the inhabitants of this burial ground and their history. In Colorado--and in some other states--there is an unofficial "caching organization" of such caches such as these as "Spirit Quests". I have not seen that designation in New York but this cache would be a great candidate for a spirit quest cache.</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Losing memory. I cannot remember when it began but it seems like I cannot even remember what cache I find in a day. I thought a solo voyage to nowhere would be good so I got dropped off at S 39.995621 E 97.325662.&lt;br /&gt;
I just floated around and occasionally looked at my GPSr. I wandered to S 41.483225 E 108.448588;&lt;br /&gt;
S 42.164663 E 85.745555; S 36.310847 E 101.409475; S 36.186747 E 85.871187 and&lt;br /&gt;
S 40.832422 E 64.236887.&lt;br /&gt;
That had taken me to six places and it still looked like I was still nowhere. One last fragment of memory took me to S 43.597772 E 82.709383. My memory started to get a little better and I finally figured out how to get through to where I wanted to go. I zipped between points and was there in no time. You will too if you want to get to the cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first to find will get a one dollar gold coin. Please bring your own pen or pencil.&lt;/p&gt;
Congratulations to yurtles for FTF !!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I definitely can relate to losing memory! But that's a different story. Had looked at this puzzle a while ago but made no progress with it so it got lost in the shuffle. Last night I started to look at this again. The first part came without issue, but what to do with that info? After I probed a bit more, I stumbled onto what I expected the answer to be. But while I was gathering that data, I decided to get something else as well. Good thing I did because my assumption was wrong but I noticed something about my backup plan and that turned out to be the way to go. With verified coords, we decided to dodge the raindrops this afternoon and go for this one. Nice walk and only got a little wet. This one hadn't been found in quite some time. Glad to get it off my plate. TFTC</groundspeak:text>

With the heavy summer growth, even short distances off the trail led to some pretty serious bushwhacking all day.  It was no different here, but hardly the worst we had to deal with today.  Got to where we needed to be and being in the lead, she spotted it first.  All was well with the cache, so we signed in and were on our way.

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;div class="UserSuppliedContent"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is an antidote to the "Are You Taz Enough" Series. The cache is at the posted coordinates, with parking nearby. There will be a lammy for the FTF tho it will not be in the cache (wont fit), we will make arrangements to get it to the FTF.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="UserSuppliedContent"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our geobuddy (The Tilley Hat) and TPP are constantly being reminded that we are not "Taz Enough" given our dismal track record trying to score smileys in the AYTE challenge caches. After one recent DNF The Tilley Hat came up with the idea of an "Are You Pink Enough" series as an antidote to the AYTE series.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An AYPE cache:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. Must be rated no higher than 1 (or 1.5) - no bushwhacking, climbing or tools required.&lt;br /&gt;
2. Requires no maths skills higher than 1 plus 1 plus 1.&lt;br /&gt;
3. Has parking nearby.&lt;br /&gt;
4. Should be placed in plain sight.&lt;br /&gt;
5. Will not require a hint.&lt;br /&gt;
6. Cannot be a lampskirt hide. While he wants this to be easy, lampskirt hides are just a little too pink for TTH taste.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Given the stringent requirements of an AYPE cache, it is vulnerable to muggles (and other wildlife). Please reattach the cache container exactly as you found it and let me know if you think it's missing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Congrats to CacheBandicoots315 on the FTF!!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">An early morning errand got me out of the house before anyone else. After a trip to the other side of the city, thought I'd try sneaking in a few caches before the 'heat' of the day. That was the plan anyway until leaving the house at 6:15AM and already having it 77degrees out!

This was the area I'd planned on beginning my caching day until passing by Indian Hill and deciding that steep hills on a HOT day sounded like a better start. [;)] 

Did the loop while trying to get to the 'smell' caches. Saw better parking and headed there though. The parking icon on the nuvi had covered the cache icon and it wasn't until I was leaving that I noticed this! Almost was able to reach it with the window down, but didn't want to risk scratching the finish on a van only a few months old. [:)] Signed in and replaced as found.

Thanks for the nice breather!</groundspeak:text>

*This is in a residential area, so please no caching after dark.
Parking coords N 43° 03.521 W 077° 27.759.*&lt;br /&gt;
Use your geosenses, no need to tear apart the area, the cache is

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;font size="+0"&gt;On this hillside is a concrete structure 30 ft
long, 8 ft wide and 7 ft high that served as a practice bunker for
soldiers training for action as part of the American Expeditionary
Force in World War I. It is assumed to have been used as a firing
range for the troops. Due to its unique nature, its possibly the
only remaining structure of its kind in the state, if not in the
country. For more info on what you find here, go to &lt;a href=

&lt;font size="+0" color="#0000FF"&gt;&lt;b&gt;This cache has been placed here
on Memorial Day weekend to help us all remember the people who have
served and died for our freedom.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cache container is a bison tube. Please replace carefully (there's
a screw to hold it in place). There is a crinkled lammy for the

Found the bunker pretty easy but had a little trouble with the cache.  I would blame the setting sun for it but the truth is that I just kept overlooking it.  Pretty interesting spot, it made me think that it was used to train the troops in trench warfare, that or that is where they set the targets up for practice and the guys who changed them had a little safety area to hang out it while they were shooting.  Either way, thanks for bringing me to the interesting spot.  TFTH</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Well Daryl has had his "Delights" (GC1QDE6) and "Dilemmas" (GC253GV), but lately he's been particularly "Swamped" so we thought this location an apt metaphor as he's lately been *chained* to his desk!

The first way point is located near a small parking area and starts you on your way.  Total hike is just under a mile (roundtrip) and passes several traditional caches and interesting creekside features - look out for the huge log - perfect for placing a cache if not for those pesky cache density rules.  

You may be tempted to make a direct assault on WP2 - probably not such a good idea without a raft - but should be able to stay on trails until the last ~150 feet if observant.

'doniuppa' warns that WP2 is a bit devious so we're looking forward to feedback [:)]

The Final should be the easiest of all.</groundspeak:long_description>

And in the area of segment two, one can see absolutely gorgeous specimens of this lovely flower. [:)] Yup--the hides are a mite tricky.  I found part 1 (did better here than on one of your other caches). A found the tricky part 2.  And we both found part 3.  Yup--will give this one a favorite vote because it takes us to a lovely area. (I am not much into tricky--though I feel good when I find tricky ones--but I am into hiking and beautiful areas.) So thanks for this one. Sorry, my camera is broken--would have taken photos of the lovely flowers--ah yes--the phlox is in bloom too--also gorgeous right now.</groundspeak:text>

This cache is part of the What The Hale (fool) knockoff series, in
celebration of the upcoming WTH series that the king of being Taz
enough will be placing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
During "Why I do this", Hale had, let us say, a wardrobe
malfunction, resulting in pants on the ground at this very spot.
Well, maybe not this very spot, but near by.</groundspeak:long_description>

Today I found myself on the trails with BroTim and we passed the correct trail to this on our first pass through, but were able to hit this on the way back.  Then as if that wasn't good enough we turn a wrong turn, did a big loop, and passed this one by again just to make a point or something.  Eventually we got out of there and back to the parking lot!

As other caches have noted, there are lots of mosquitoes in the area.  Luckily I found the cache quickly and got out before I was drained of all blood.  LOL

I came on the right day though! the ground was hard and frozen but very few pacthes of ice. With the hilly terrain, if I had come a few days earlier, or even a few hours later, it would have been a diffferent story. I really liked the hike and legs felt great after the workout. Cache has a cracked lid but still quite dry. I removed some ice inside and should be good to go for awhile. TFTC</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Greetings!

I noticed that your cache has the needs maintenance attribute set.  This is generally caused when a cacher posts a "needs maintenance log on  your cache for a number of reasons.  If you have addressed the issue or believe there is no issue, you can remove this attribute by posting an "owner maintenance" log, or editing the attribute list to remove it (note on caches other than traditional, the needs maintenance icon does not show, but clicking "Update Attributes" will clear it anyway.)

Often people will filter out caches that require maintenance so making sure this is correct will help cachers find your cache.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">An early morning errand got me out of the house before anyone else. After a trip to the other side of the city, thought I'd try sneaking in a few caches before the 'heat' of the day. That was the plan anyway until leaving the house at 6:15AM and already having it 77degrees out!

This was the area I'd planned on beginning my caching day until passing by Indian Hill and deciding that steep hills on a HOT day sounded like a better start. [;)]

Final cache for my 'smell' loop in the baseball area. Past the maintenance man who was mowing. What a hot day to be working outside. He was probably thinking 'what a hot day for someone to be taking a hike!' [;)]

Followed the geo-trail but couldn't spot the cache. Worked my way through the area and found it took some contorting to get into the position to make the find. Retrieved and found the log to be pretty wet. Didn't have any replacement logs with me. My pen was able to leave my mark but it appears the paper is on its last legs.

I came up with an idea for him.&lt;br /&gt;
I'd hate to see him Sully his reputation&lt;br /&gt;
but it would be pretty cool to see him land here...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img alt src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8114/8658517515_4b57a3aaf4_m.jpg" style="width:180px;height:240px;" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;If he takes me up on my suggestion,&lt;br /&gt;
I have a canoe tethered nearby to go rescue people off the wing of his airplane,&lt;br /&gt;
and any cachers on board could find a cache while they're waiting for me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;At the parking coordinates, you will find another Sullys Trail that will lead you to the cache.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;PLEASE BE CAREFUL NOT TO BREAK THE TETHER THAT SECURES THE CACHE.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONGRATS TO CACHE CPL (A) AND PINKPANTHERS1995 (D) FOR THE JOINT FTF.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

I expanded my search and spotted the clever hide.  Signed in and started bac to the car.  Well that is when the rain really started to come down.  Needless to say I ran the rest of the way.  Good thing I had an extra shirt in the car.

I was able to grab 5 Tilley caches today, it seems they are everywhere!  Hopefully I can grab some more tomorrow and then continue to play catch up on getting them all.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well, this was the geocaching equivalent of buzzing the tower (ala Top Gun). The whole family came to the park today because:
a) it was a beautiful day,
b) kid #1 had wanted for a long time to go fishing, and
c) an aunt &amp; uncle were up visiting who had an extra fishing pole, and
d) we weren't aware of the fishing restrictions at the ponds.
So, long story short, we enjoyed feeding the fish; a few of us explored over to Lake Lacoma, then settled in near the creek to try our hand at fishing there. While #1 &amp; #2 got their fishing lessons, I took #3 (a 2-yr old) in his stroller over to the nearby cache. Was going well until the final 100 feet, which became stroller un-friendly (the "difficult climbing" attribute on the web page is appropriate, but didn't show through on my GPSr). The 2-yr old didn't want to be left alone long enough to make it to GZ, so this smiley will have to wait for another day :)</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">An early morning errand got me out of the house before anyone else. After a trip to the other side of the city, thought I'd try sneaking in a few caches before the 'heat' of the day. That was the plan anyway until leaving the house at 6:15AM and already having it 77degrees out!

This was the area I'd planned on beginning my caching day until passing by Indian Hill and deciding that steep hills on a HOT day sounded like a better start. [;)] This was the first cache in the area I'd intended to start my day in. The temperature had only gone up since I'd left the house!

Parked nearby and knew the CO would be proud of my walking distance to this one. Could have gotten a bit closer but maintenance was mowing and it wouldn't have been good form to drive over his pristine grass!

Found quickly. Signed in and was happy to move along since today was an exceptional smell day.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">An early morning errand got me out of the house before anyone else. After a trip to the other side of the city, thought I'd try sneaking in a few caches before the 'heat' of the day. That was the plan anyway until leaving the house at 6:15AM and already having it 77degrees out!

This was the area I'd planned on beginning my caching day until passing by Indian Hill and deciding that steep hills on a HOT day sounded like a better start. [;)]

The heat had done a good job zapping my energy by this time. Parked down the road at the lot and walked down to the search area. Enjoyed the shade and relative peacefulness of the area while looking for the cache. The container showed itself quickly. Signed in and replaced before heading down the road for one last long walk in the heat before calling it a day.

Thanks for all the fun!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">An early morning errand got me out of the house before anyone else. After a trip to the other side of the city, thought I'd try sneaking in a few caches before the 'heat' of the day. That was the plan anyway until leaving the house at 6:15AM and already having it 77degrees out!

This was the area I'd planned on beginning my caching day until passing by Indian Hill and deciding that steep hills on a HOT day sounded like a better start. [;)]

Found my way out of the woods and headed along the tree line while the maintenance person mowed the far side of the field. Dove in at a good spot for searching and took a moment to produce the container. Signed in and replaced as found.

Take note near the cache, just NE about 100' is a stange pile of rocks that have obviously been there a very long time. They may mark some sort of tribal area. You be the judge.

I recommend entering from the SE border of the park along the farmers field, it is a little bit dryer this way. Either way you go you will need boots this time of year, it is surprisingly wet in most areas.

It was a blustery, cold day and we had the entire place to ourselves today.  It is definitely an area we wouldn't have found without your geocache to lead the way.

Perinton.&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is a replacement for the original &lt;a href=
"http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=d632392f-c6f7-49ec-ac0b-99f1e830e7f5"&gt;
On Top of an Esker&lt;/a&gt; placed by JungleHair which has gone missing.
Rather than replace the cache in the same spot and have it go
missing again, I've hidden it in the same general area but far
enough away that it is a new cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The trailhead is located at N 43° 03.188 / W077° 27.851. Parking is
available across the road at the Horizon Hill parking area. The
first part of the trail looks like someone's back yard, but don't
worry, you are on the right path. This will be a fairly long and
strenuous hike through a hilly woodland area along well established
trails. Be sure to take plenty of water and bug spray with you in
the summer (although I wasn't bothered by the bugs when I placed
the cache). There is also some poison ivy in the area, so watch
your step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The terrain is result of the Wisconsin glaciation approximately
20,000 years ago which also carved the finger lakes. You will be
hiking to the top of an esker (a long, low snake-like ridge of sand
and gravel, created when the deposits of subsurface glacial streams
are placed on the ground after glacial melting).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is in a lock-n-lock and contains various dollar store
items. Satellite reception can be tricky in these woods, so I
bumped the difficulty rating up a bit. If you have trouble, the
hint uses landmarks to help you find it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For those who prefer a shorter hike, there is an alternate
trailhead at N43° 03.884 / W077° 27.643, or at the Mormon Church on
Kreag Rd. But if you enjoy hiking, take the long route - it's
definitely worth it. The short route is only available in the
summer since parking is not allowed in the winter unless you park
at the church.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

We had done the original cache and were happy to do this one. We really enjoy the eskers in this area. Picked up the TB and will likely take it to Colorado in a few months (will drop it in and out of caches in the meantime) because Colorado too had a gold rush. Thanks so much for redoing this one. Oh, did your dog accompany you when you placed this one? This trail certainly is a nice one for dogs.

The trail just wasnt lining up the the gps for this one so I just went for it! steep drop down and big hike up. . .then again. I found the cache and took the more scenic and less direct route backk to the car. Thanks for the cache and bringing me alllll the way back.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well I was happy that u found the trail head on Little Spring Run, the cache seemed nice and close. I should have started with a different cache as a warm up. Doing these hills first thing in the morning was a workout. I am glad I missed this one the other day when I was in the area, it would have been too much on the dog that day.

Today turned out to be perfect and I really enjoyed the area and the cache, thanks for a really great time.</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This is the fourth in our Magical Creatures series!  If you've already found Fairy Cache, Gnome Cache and Unicorn Cache, then it should be no surprise to see what type of area in which you'll find yourself.  Made by kids and for all ages, this cache has a story to tell.  However, unlike the other caches, we want you to finish the story for yourself.  &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is hidden in a beautiful spot overlooking the agricultural land in Penn Yan of the Finger Lakes area.  Inside the container you'll find a sheet of paper on which is written the story of mermaids.  The cache contains approximately 10 &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;real&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt; mermaid tails.  Did you know mermaids shed their tails like children lose teeth?  These tails were given to us by the Mermaid Fairy.  Please, if you've found that the cache only contains one or two more tails, let us know, because we'd like to refill it.  No need to leave swag or prizes yourself; just take one of the tails.  Each one has a label telling you which mermaid lost it. When you've left this cache, we'd love for you to write us your ending to the story.  Or write it down for yourself!  Use your imagination, which is where all magical creatures reside.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Hide would be rated a 1.0 but I made it a 2.0 because of the high muggle factor at times, especially in good weather and even more so during "after-school hours". Please be stealthy and place the cache back carefully when teenage muggles are hanging around.  Best to retrieve this cache during the times when the nearby business is open.

Thanks for a do-able puzzle and a really nice walk, Sase and I had a great time caching in here. It even gave us both some lonely points!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Our intrepid group of cachers was headed after some puzzles today and this was one of them. I hadn't solved it yet but figured I could do so before I logged it. Area was pretty dry today and we found the cache with no problem. I had been here for other caches in the past but never this far down into the park. Nice trails and a nice walk today. Came home and tackled the puzzle so I could feel I legitimately earned my smiley today. I have seen puzzles like this before so had an idea of what to do, just wasn't sure quite how to do it. After playing with it for 10-15 minutes, I finally figured it out and had the coords. Fun puzzle and a neat area, tftc. :)</groundspeak:text>

 Cache is located in Semmel Road Park, a little known park in
Mendon. There are tennis courts, basketball courts, playgrounds,
and hiking trails. &lt;b&gt;Park is closed after dark, so please do not
hunt for it if it is dark out (even if it means giving up a
FTF).&lt;/b&gt; There is a theme appropriate book (hitchhikers guide to
the galaxy) for the FTF (if they want it). There is also a picture
frame, a pair of sunglasses, a premaid cache, and some other
trinkets.&lt;b&gt;Congrats to Team Bigdawg for the FTF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

 This is #5 in my TV series of puzzle caches. They are caches
designed to tax your brain and your caching skills, but not be
impossible. This one is named after my second favorite TV show,
LOST, as well as Lost in Space. Hope you enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;

I'd never been to this particular area before, and I couldn't have asked for a better evening to check it out and to hunt for the cache.  I really enjoyed the location of the hide.  Thanks for the fun puzzle and for pointing out this spot to me!</groundspeak:text>

Had lots of fun with this, and it quickly jumped to must find status.  Today, I was 'in the area'  (only 8 or 10 miles away!) and made it back here.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">One of 9 puzzles found today on a caching trip to Rochester with cheryyll.  I had made an error which we managed to correct easily when we realized we were nowhere near where we were supposed to be.  Finding the right way to get to the cache was quite a challenge, but we persevered.  I never would have made this hike if there weren't a nice blue question mark at the end!  cheryyll made the actual grab, and I was so glad our efforts to get there did not end in a DNF.  Thanks for the creative puzzle, and the cache. [:)]</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">I hope your bikes are in working order, because that is the intended mode of transportation for this series. Between Palmyra and Newark there are 12 colored bison tubes placed along the Erie Canal Trail. Each cache will count as a separate smiley, so be sure to sign each log. On six of the bison tubes there is a metal tag with a letter and a number. Make note of this information, as it will be needed to find the final in the series: “Erie Canalside Bike Ride: Grand Finale”. The caches containing this information will not be designated on the cache pages, so you must find all 12 micros to get the final. Please do not mention anything about getting needed information in your logs, or they will be deleted. Not knowing which caches have final coord information is part of the fun (for me anyway)! The series is about 17 miles round trip, assuming you start at the posted parking coordinates. The terrain rating on the caches will get higher the further they are from the parking coordinates, because this series is meant to be done in one trip. Happy pedaling!</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I had been waiting for some cooler weather to make this find so the mosquitoes would be less aggressive.  Well that part worked well, but the gates were closed so I had a longer walk.  I guess you can't have it both ways.  Beautiful day for a walk and made it to GZ no problem.  The terrain is a bit odd isn't it?  I searched around a while and then checked for a hint.  I'm glad it was there because my GPS had me 34 ft away.  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">An early morning errand got me out of the house before anyone else. After a trip to the other side of the city, thought I'd try sneaking in a few caches before the 'heat' of the day. That was the plan anyway until leaving the house at 6:15AM and already having it 77degrees out!

This was the area I'd planned on beginning my caching day until passing by Indian Hill and deciding that steep hills on a HOT day sounded like a better start. [;)]  

This was the second cache in the area that I'd planned on starting my day in. Bushwhacked in from the cache closer to parking and soon was at the search area. Found a very healthy poison ivy vine where my GPSr took me. Gave in quickly and checked the cache description. The hint took me about 30-40 feet away to a much friendlier area and with a cache just waiting to be signed! Left my mark and headed further into the woods.</groundspeak:text>

I was glad I had put on bug spray in spite of the fact that up until this one they had not bothered me.  I was ok until getting to ground zero and then they all attacked. I guess Death Walker had not feed them enough!  Signed in right after him again. His name was the only one there as I see that Tilley had just shoved in the blank sheet and run for his life too! I don't think I would have been able to read Death Walkers name if I hadn't seen it all day, it looked like he scrawled it as quickly as I did mine.

Geocoin Geocat ready to move on for FTF. BYO Pencil, I didn't have one. Also includes a 'grow your own' bird toy and a magnet.  Happy caching!  Congrats to the FTF blazy colors.  Name is also a tribute to having to wake up to the heat turned on before fall begins... brr!   Room for travel coins and trade items, size is small  but not tiny :-)

Should be a quick find. Congrats to refinders who find this in its new location (formerly H20)    Cache placed with permission of HFJOhn who had the last cache on the site, hope this one doesn't get muggled.   Room for trade items.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">CCGDad and I had almost made it to this one from G8 when I finally got around to checking previous logs to see when this one had been found last.  I totally groaned when I saw the two previous DNFs. We were pretty hungry, it was drizzling, and we might have chosen to skip it had I checked sooner, but we since we were almost there already we decided to give it a once-over anyway.  I was getting down to planning a search strategy when CCGDad nonchalantly made the find.  Whew!  Another square in the grid filled in - thanks!</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;Cache is located in an area with over 5 miles of hiking trails. The seven ecosystem plant communities include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red Maple Hardwood Swamp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Northern Hardwood Stand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Northern White Cedar Swamp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Old Farm Fields and Pastures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Floodplain Forest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rich Mesophytic Forest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep Emergent Marsh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a .50 caliber ammo can, located a few steps off the trail. No bushwacking is required to reach the cache. At placement time, parts of the trail were murky, but in mostly good condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A first to find prize of a travel bug tag is in an envelope, but if still there and you're not FTF feel free to take it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">During the summer, I work at a summer daycamp with kids ages 5-12.  We go on field trips twice a week to various establishments and parks in and around the Rochester, NY area.

This year I was telling my kids about the wonders and excitement of GEOCACHING and suddenly I have a group of 15+ campers who are completely obsessed with what they are and where they could be.  Every day I field tons of questions; on every field trip I have kids looking in random places for them...

Today we took a trip to Powder Mill Park and I thought, what a great way to involve them in my newest favorite pasttime, GEOCACHING.  Before leaving our home base, we decorated a small container and added a log book with a pencil.  The container has room for small trade items.  Once at the park, we took a short hike on a well maintained trail and then into the woods where we found what the kids considered to be a perfect spot for a cache.  They are waiting impatiently for me to tell them someone has found it!</groundspeak:long_description>

I'm a friend and a co-worker of Z-files, he introduced me in geo-cacheing and I love it.So I like to Celebrate with Z-Files team and place a Golden Ammo Can for him and his son, they have worked hard to get here. I have enjoyed caching with them, they are great cachers. I know the place to set the cache, just waiting for the right time, the trails can be very wet and muddy at times, just pick the right trail.

Most of all HAVE FUN and ENJOY the find.


CONGRADULATION TO Mrs.Z-files for the first to find</groundspeak:long_description>

This is an antidote to the "Are You Taz Enough" Series. The cache is at the posted coordinates, with parking nearby.  There will be a lammy for the FTF tho it will not be in the cache (wont fit), we will make arrangements to get it to the FTF.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Our geobuddy (The Tilley Hat) and TPP are constantly being reminded that we are not "Taz Enough" given our dismal track record trying to score smileys in the AYTE challenge caches. After one recent DNF The Tilley Hat came up with the idea of an "Are You Pink Enough" series as an antidote to the AYTE series.

An AYPE cache:

1. Must be rated no higher than 1 (or 1.5) - no bushwhacking, climbing or tools required.
2. Requires no maths skills higher than 1 plus 1 plus 1.
3. Has parking nearby.
4. Should be placed in plain sight.
5. Will not require a hint.
6. Cannot be a lampskirt hide. While he wants this to be easy, lampskirt hides are just a little too pink for TTH taste. 

Given the stringent requirements of an AYPE cache, it is vulnerable to muggles (and other wildlife). Please reattach the cache container exactly as you found it and let me know if you think it's missing.</groundspeak:long_description>

It's so nice, I found it twice!

We were in the area for an appointment, so after we were done with that, LuLu, Gravy, and I stopped out to the Rec Center to look for a cache. Coming up empty there and burning the last of the daylight, we drove over to the trailhead here. I had searched for this once before, but came up empty. Today,  I made up for that DNF and found this one twice! Two separate containers were just inches apart. I signed the pinker of the two and replaced both. I also found an interesting spot where these may have been hidden before, but I left them where I found them.

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">I hope your bikes are in working order, because that is the intended mode of transportation for this series. Between Palmyra and Newark there are 12 colored bison tubes placed along the Erie Canal Trail. Each cache will count as a separate smiley, so be sure to sign each log. On six of the bison tubes there is a metal tag with a letter and a number. Make note of this information, as it will be needed to find the final in the series: “Erie Canalside Bike Ride: Grand Finale”. The caches containing this information will not be designated on the cache pages, so you must find all 12 micros to get the final. Please do not mention anything about getting needed information in your logs, or they will be deleted. Not knowing which caches have final coord information is part of the fun (for me anyway)! The series is about 17 miles round trip, assuming you start at the posted parking coordinates. The terrain rating on the caches will get higher the further they are from the parking coordinates, because this series is meant to be done in one trip. Happy pedaling!</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">An early morning errand got me out of the house before anyone else. After a trip to the other side of the city, thought I'd try sneaking in a few caches before the 'heat' of the day. That was the plan anyway until leaving the house at 6:15AM and already having it 77degrees out!

This was the area I'd planned on beginning my caching day until passing by Indian Hill and deciding that steep hills on a HOT day sounded like a better start. [;)]

Was doing a loop of 'smell' caches out closer to the baseball fields and this was too inviting to pass up. Kept expecting to find a path on my way to the cache but never encountered one until well on my way out and a good amount West from where I'd entered the woods.

Zeroed out at a good spot of searching for the cache. Quickly found the cache and had the log in hand. It was damp but sign-able. Sorry I didn't have a replacement handy.

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The wetlands area of High Acres has been under revitalization for some time now.   Some of the trails are now open, where you can see the additional ponds and marshes they have added.

It is still a bit stark here, but I assume more native plants will be grown over time.    There were a lot of water fowl here today when I planted the cache, and a lot of deer tracks near the water.

At this time, some of the trails are still closed so you may have to take a longer route between the waypoints than you normally would once the trails are open again.

This is a two part multi, with the final being a decon container.   At waypoint one please stay on the trails side of the fence.    There is no reason to cross over, under, or through the fence, or cause damage to anything nearby.

I advise against doing this in the dark, as it would probably be difficult, and the trails may be closed during darkness.

At the first waypoint, you will be looking for partial coordinates, just prefix the 43 and 77.

Clever way to present the coords.  However, still being confused - I contacted Chile, who helped me out with confirming the final coords.  It was a beautiful day for the journey to the final.  At first WP, it was dry ...but definitely found the wet on way to the final.  Searched unsuccessfully for quite awhile before giving Buck a call.... he was able to remember just enough for me to determine that I needed to expand my search into a different area.  Another 10 minutes or so and I finally found the cache....30' off from what my GPSr was reading....but, I will blame the sats and my machine, not your coords!

Decided to give this one a try.  Kudos on the stages I found.  Stage 1 was a blast.  I was a good 25 feet away when I spotted something off.  Stage 2 was something I had seen before, and it blends in well.  Stage 3...  Stage 3...  I have written many a two word poems about pine trees.  I recited many of them today.  They are not polite.  I could not find stage 3.  I am sure it is there, and I am just missing it.  Maybe I will have time to try it again befiore I leave!</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">This multi-cache is located in Silver Hill Technology Park, in
Newark, NY. It’s a long one with some steep hills. It took us (with
a 5 and 7 year old) about 1½ hours to hike the cache trail and feed
the geese. Your job is to find 4 jewels used in making jewelry, and
then the final cache (ammo can). Make sure to bring bug spray and
lots of bread to feed the ducks, geese and HUGE catfish.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Many Newark residents still call the park by it’s old name, Sarah
Coventry, which was the original owner of this property. The Sarah
Coventry jewelry company was founded in Newark, New York by Charles
H. Stuart in November, 1949. He named the company after his
granddaughter Sarah. This propensity of naming companies after
family members he had started earlier in naming the Emmons company
after his wife Caroline Emmons. Emmons Home Fashion started
marketing jewelry in 1948 and the Sarah Coventry brand was
established the following year in November, 1949. Emmons and Sarah
Coventry did not design or manufacture pieces themselves, but
rather contracted with third parties for designs and outsourced
their manufacture mostly in the Providence, RI area. Sarah Coventry
had a Lifetime Guarantee- the cards stated “may be sent back for
repair to: P.O. Box 7899, Warwick, RI 02887. Please include
handling charge of 1.50”. Sarah Coventry jewelry was sold at
“fashion shows” in people’s homes until 1984, when the company was
sold. In 2002 the jewelry was once again available on the Home
Shopping Network, and in 2003 they resumed selling at home parties,
bringing the company history full circle.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Directional Help:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
On your way to the starting point, follow the path in front of the
FLCC bldg. and then head up the grassy hill to the right. On your
way to the third cache stay on the trail until you see the path
going down the hill. On your way to the final cache, head right,
around the pond.&lt;br&gt;
**Update** This area is now the home of the Finger Lakes Community
College Wayne Campus Center and is bound to receive more traffic.
Please be aware of muggles in the area.&lt;br&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I have resisted doing this one for a long time (even though I have the rest of the area cleared out) because I hate investing a lot of time in a multi only to not be able to find the last waypoint or two.  I'm glad I came here with S4C today because he saved my bacon on WP3. We both looked on the other side of the trail for what seemed like a half hour until he expanded his search much wider than I would have. The other waypoints were easy-peasy.

As S4C mentioned, WP2 needs help. It looks like an animal gnawed through it.

This is a great area back here, I'm surprised that there aren't more caches.  We had a good hike and found the first 2 WPs easily.  WP2 could really use a new container.  WP3 we searched for a long time with no find and expanded our search a few times.  Then I crossed the trail and found quickly.  The last two stops were found with no troubles and we were glad to find this semi-lonely cache.  Thanks for the fun.</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache is the next installment in the Seneca Lake History Series.  The first person listed, Caleb Culver, was a “Fence Viewer” for the Town of Seneca.  So, what is a fence viewer?  

 

This historic position was first established in 1693 by a statute in Massachusetts which was amended in 1785 and again in 1836.  It was an appointed position in every town, where upon request the fence viewer:

-          views fences to see that they are in good repair

-          in case of disputes between neighbors, works to resolve their differences, such as settlement for disputes arising between adjacent neighbors due do trespass or damage done by livestock that have escaped enclosure.

-          Determines encroachment of boundary lines and monitors that fences are built and sustained to code.  Problems such as size, condition, and distance form property lines are complaints that still arise between neighbors and call for the office of the Fence Viewer.

 

A few New England and Mid Western States continue today to maintain formal Fence Viewer appointed positions in local towns and municipalities.

 

Enjoy this little trot off the main path and picture what this area looked like 100-200 years ago and realize how important Fence Viewers used to be in society.

You do not need to enter the cemetery-just pay your respects from outside the cemetery. Bring your own pen and paper to record your piece of local history. 


PLEASE..PLEASE..PLEASE,BE VERY CAREFUL GETTING AND REPLACING THE CONTAINER.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We got out before the rains came to grab as many caches as we could while camping at Camper's Haven this weekend. After hiking the Ontario Pathways Trail, we swung by here get the caches along this stretch of road. This was our last stop before heading back to the campground, and just in time too! This is a beautiful little cemetary. We admired the statue that sits on the hill in the middle. JH found this one for us in the first spot she looked.

This year the members hid a cache along the canal trail section they cleaned and dedicated the cache to Past Commander (P/C) John Burns.
A nice walk or bike ride on the canal trail will bring you to this cache.

Update 7/13/2012: My airedale terrier Issaquah Puppy passed away today from cancer. She was an avid geocacher and had visited over 100 caches at a time when that was still a challenge and few people in New State had hit that mark. Please give her a thought when you visit her caches.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">An early morning errand got me out of the house before anyone else. After a trip to the other side of the city, thought I'd try sneaking in a few caches before the 'heat' of the day. That was the plan anyway until leaving the house at 6:15AM and already having it 77degrees out!

This was the area I'd planned on beginning my caching day until passing by Indian Hill and deciding that steep hills on a HOT day sounded like a better start. [;)] 

Parked at the far lot not realizing there is one on this side of the park now. The energy tank was low due to the heat. Enjoyed the surroundings on my way in. The paths have matured nicely over the past few years. The hustle and bustle going on across the street quieted down by the time I arrived at the search site. Tried to avoid the poison ivy as I scanned the area while waiting for my GPSr to settle in on an area. Spotted the container before it did. Retrieved, signed in and replaced a bit better than found.

Thanks for the reason for taking a nice hike today!</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="False">The cache lies near East Street Burial Ground, wherein lies Simon Stone. The cache is a 7.62mm ammo can, and contains lots of goodies. Easy cache, historical. Trades welcome. Please no cloth/plush items.</groundspeak:short_description>

Simon Stone, the co-founder of Northfield, which would later become Pittsford, lies in this burial ground. He was born November 18th, 1762 in New Ipswich, New Hampshire.  Although only 12 years old when the Revolution broke out, he was old enough to fight before the end of the war. On July 30, 1780, he enlisted from the town of Deerfield as a private at 17 years of age.  He was small of stature, light in complexion and possessed blond hair.  His regiment was raised in Hampshire county to reinforce the Continental Army for 3 months.  About 1797, Simon went from Deerfield to Salem, Washington County, NY, where his cousin, Israel had previously located.

Simon married Hannah Nye in 1788 in Salem.  She was the daughter of Silas and Patience Carpenter Nye, who with their children emigrated to "Stonetown". There were other Stone-Nye marriages among the pioneers in early day Pittsford.

The Pittsford area was known to white men long before the arrival of the first permanent settlers in 1789. It was crisscrossed by major Seneca Indian trails. Its fertile land made it the site of Indian villages.  It was first noted into history in 1687, when the Marquis De Denonville, leading a French army on a punitive expedition against the Seneca Indians, camped in what is now the vicinity of State Street and South Street at what then was known as "Big Spring", a large ever-flowing spring which was later incorporated into the Erie Canal.
 
The Buffalo Creek Indian Treaty of 1788 opened the area for settlement.  In 1788-89, Simon, Israel, and Seth Dodge formed a partnership. On February 21, 1789 they purchased 13,000 acres in "Genesee Country" for about $5,000. It amounted to one shilling and one penny per acre. Dodge relinquished his claim to the Stone cousins. Simon and Israel rode on horseback to this Genesee area, selected home sites, cleared some land and planted a crop of winter wheat. Israel built the first house in Pittsford, now marked with an historic sign near the Erie canal at 38 State Street, at the site of the “Big Spring.” The town first was called Northfield, and was later split into Brighton and Pittsford.

After Simon and his cousin had planted their crop and built log houses, they returned to Salem and persuaded many friends and family to come to this area.  Much of the early activity in Pittsford was farming but early residents also made use of abundant sand, gravel, and limestone, supplying these to a considerable area.

Nearby Irondequoit Creek provided power for a grist mill built by Simon in 1791, the remains of which can still be found near where the Irondequoit Creek passes under the Erie Canal, close to the cache “Canal Bypass” (GCQZWN by ChileHead).  This mill pre-dates the flour mill at Powder Mill by more than 70 years.  Simon’s mill ground local grain to serve the local distilleries, as whiskey was an important product of the frontier. It could be transported to other parts of the region more easily than bulky grain.

Soon after building the grist mill, Stone erected a saw mill. With the arrival of this mill, trees could be turned into logs and logs could be tuned into boards and those boards could be used for building frame houses, thus giving the community a more settled look - which would attract more families and grow into a thriving place.

In 1797 Simon was commissioned a lieutenant in the Ontario County militia. During 1804, he accepted a commission as a captain. In 1805, then 43 years of age and presumably in ill health, he resigned his commission.

Simon and Hannah had ten children, nine of which were born in Pittsford. Their names were Orrin, Alfred, Anathusia, Sophia, Israel, Charlotte, Elias, Adolphus, Hannah, and Elin. Hannah died April 1821 at age 52 and is buried in the Pioneer Cemetery. Simon died October, 1832 and was laid to rest here in the East Street Burial Ground near Park Road.

There used to be an American Flag and a "Founder of Pittsford" sign near his headstone, but those appear to be missing. The town historian plans to pursue getting more recognition for this founding father through the organization called The Sons of the American Revolution. We owe a debt of gratitude to this early pioneer and his enterprising cousin, Israel for recognizing the wonderful advantages of this fertile area and their foresight in what it could become.

Found part of the final coords but was running short on time so had to leave without the other half.  That nagged at me so I had to return tonight to finish this one off.  Took a few minutes before the lightbulb went off and the last piece of the puzzle was in hand.  I wasn't long after that my name was in the log book.

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">I hope your bikes are in working order, because that is the intended mode of transportation for this series. Between Palmyra and Newark there are 12 colored bison tubes placed along the Erie Canal Trail. Each cache will count as a separate smiley, so be sure to sign each log. On six of the bison tubes there is a metal tag with a letter and a number. Make note of this information, as it will be needed to find the final in the series: “Erie Canalside Bike Ride: Grand Finale”. The caches containing this information will not be designated on the cache pages, so you must find all 12 micros to get the final. Please do not mention anything about getting needed information in your logs, or they will be deleted. Not knowing which caches have final coord information is part of the fun (for me anyway)! The series is about 17 miles round trip, assuming you start at the posted parking coordinates. The terrain rating on the caches will get higher the further they are from the parking coordinates, because this series is meant to be done in one trip. Happy pedaling!</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">To finish up the 31 Days of Geocaching, we figured to take an evening trip to attempt the Erie Canalside Bike Ride series.  This was the first cache for Day 31 (logged shortly after midnight)... and it is the last cache needed to claim a smiley every day in August!  We did it!  We completed the challenge!

We didn't park at the given parking coords, as it was after dark. Instead, we parked down the road and road our bikes to the path. We left the truck shortly after 9pm and returned to the truck near 1am. 

Found #2, DNF'd #3, found #4... skipped over #5 - #11 (read our other ECBR series logs to know why).

After a brief search, E called out with the huckle!  Not what we expected to find, but it was the cache!  The log was dry, but we used the last of the decent white space.  A new log is needed.

Well, we will be back - maybe tomorrow, since we will be out this way for the Rochester R/C Heli Jamboree - to try to reverse our DNF and to find the ones we skipped over.  TFTC</groundspeak:text>
