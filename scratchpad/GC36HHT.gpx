   <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This cache is hidden in the Hopeland area of the Mills-Norrie State Park.
The container is a painted pill bottle. It is big enough to hold a few smalll swag items &amp; geocoins. Please replace it the same way as you found it and arrange the hide the same way.  You will know what I mean when you find it. (I don’t want to give too much away.) Pencil supplied, but BYOP just in case.
Small reward for FTF. All comments welcomed.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Who will be FTF?  And they're off!  birder428 is checking for new caches... Fairladyny coming up on the rail... JamaBo going outside...  MSTzilla gaining ground...  as they come around to the home stretch... bneiman starts his sprint...  jmonti and muncie56 gaining... and here comes big dawgs!! And who is this?  It's Shelly PBC! They are neck and neck. And the FTF is birder428!!  Shelly PBC is STF.

FTF CONGRATS to birder428.  STF to Shelly PBC. 


The Hopeland Park trails are well maintained for a nice easy hike.  There are benches along the way.  When this cache was placed, there were 2 other caches in the park. Find all 3. Lots of wildlife to enjoy.  Park in the park’s parking lot off of Old Post Road.
*Park is open year round from sunrise until sunset*

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">#414 - Up here in Staatsburg from NJ .  I've passed this park many times and this was on my list to check out.   Very nice area, with nice cinder trails.    Of course, to get to GZ I had to walk thru tall grass and some wood (it looked like some of the grass was beaten down by others who recently looked.    Coords has me all over the place, even close to the pone at one time.   Saw something unusual and thought the cache was there.....but came up empty...or so I thought.     Thanks to the hint, upon further investigation, I scored a smiley.  Nicely hidden.    SL, TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">My first visit to this park and my second find of the day. My gps was telling me look closer and closer to the pond, until I was right on the shore. It told me to keep going, but I decided that the cache was probably not submerged and getting my feet soaked on such a cold day was not a good idea. I looked in the opposite direction and after a few minutes of searching, I finally make the find. TNLNSL.</groundspeak:text>
