   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This is a multi-cache in memory of a family friend named Mikey. At an early age Mikey was sporting a moustache that earned him the awe of his peers. He was a wonderful young man and we want to remember him. We placed this cache in a park where children play, people walk the pathway and there is a variety of wildlife enjoying the wetland. If you can, take a minute to enjoy the vista over the field when the sun is setting, and the quiet grace of herons hunting in the pond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The waypoint is a cammo tube with the coordinates for the final on an index card. The final is a lock-n-lock with a little room for tradeables and trackables. Use your geo-sense for the final.&lt;/p&gt;
This cache was muggled and replaced on 8/10 at 6:30 PM. Please let me know asap if it is missing again. I may have to reconsider the final location.

Geocachers often visit these "places".  The coodinates will take you very close to this place, but you may have trouble getting there; however the sign will tell you why this place in unique to the State of New York.</groundspeak:short_description>

2) You may post your find immediately after finding out what type of place it is and why it is unique, but you must also email me upon posting telling me the uniqueness of the location.

Hope I have you wondering just what this place could be. Despite what some maps may show you shouldn't have to get wet.</groundspeak:long_description>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="False">A short walk down the Ontario County Pathways from the parking lot on Ontario St. in Canandaigua will take you to this cache.  There is no need to go closer to the railroad tracks than the pathway goes.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The cache is on the side of the trail away from the railraod tracks.  THERE IS NO REASON TO GO NEAR THE TRACKS.  Stay on the safe and legal side of the pathway.

A little history:  In 1900 36 trains came through Canandaigua every day on the tracks near the trail, and the tracks that used to run on this rails-to-trials trail.  Now the train comes about twice a week.
   The property for the Ontario Pathways trail that you will be walking on was purcahsed from the Penn. Central railroad in 1994 after being abandoned for over 20 years.  They have cleared the entire completed portion of the trail to a width of 12 feet.  Currently 21 miles of the trail are open, and 2 more miles of trail are yet to be finished.  Unlike the railroads, the ontario pathway is a growing work in progress.
   The giant brick building across the railroad tracks from the parking is the old Lisk factory.  It was a major producer of stainless enamelware until it was closed in 1966.  Check out the information kisok in the parking lot for more history of the trail, railroads, and Lisk.

The cache:  Originally it contained a small TB, an FTF button, the first release of a new signature item of mine (bonus: can you tell me what it is and how it got like that?), one die, a logbook and pencils.  It could be quite difficult or very easy.  Make sure to REPLACE IT EXACTLY AS YOU FOUND IT!!!  Once again the cache is on the south side of the trail, away from the railroad tracks.  Be careful of the vegetation when searching for this cache.  Use the strength of your mind, not of your body, when finding this cache.  Log your DNFs!

You can continue on down the trail about 1 mile to find "Boars Nest" and about 2.5 miles to find D, W and S.

The parking lot is off of Ontario street not far west of the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

There’s peace and quiet, beauty and repose
It’s hidden in a valley beside a mountain stream
And lying there beside it
I find that I can dream "

Those are lyrics from a camp song we used to sing years ago and for some reason when I visit the small cemeteries, it always comes to mind. They may not be "hidden in a valley beside a mountain stream" but they are peaceful places to me.  I have enjoyed finding some of the small graveyards that others have brought me to while caching and I wanted to share a few of the ones I have found.

I go by this on my way to visit my mom in Canandaigua. It is listed as the Cooley Cemetery and there are only a few graves. Enjoy the quiet while you look for the cache.  Please do not search after dark.

Cache container is a small camo'd pill bottle. Please rehide it carefully. The grounds here seem well kept up and it could easily be discovered if left exposed. There was a pencil when I hid it but bring one to be sure.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Made a quick try for the three between cr10 &amp; cr4. Went 2 of 3 before it got too dark.  Nice find in a neat location.  Took a bit of looking as it was getting dark fast. It was a bit of a hike.  Log book is wet and full.  Added a paw print charm and stamped the log.  Thanks

Cache is on the side of the trail, you do not need to leave the trail to find.

Please note I had a +/- of 17 ft when I placed this cache...my PN-20 wouldnt get any more refined than that. If someone finds this, please post your cords if mine are to far off.

Please return the cache to the same position it was left in to avoid muggling.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Today we were on a mission on this our 2nd Annual Father/Daughter geo-day:  Battleships (we only got 14) and beat last year's record of 38 caches in a day.  CACHE GOAL:  40.   We started out doing some awesome caches on some cool trails, but by the time we made it to Canadaigua we were loosing steam as well as daylight.  I was only picking P&amp;Gs or we weren't going to make it.  

I saw this was close to the road, but after reading the hit/miss finds I figured we didn't have time for its possible difficulty level.  Dad saw it on his Garmin and said - let's do it!  Okay, dad . . . okay.  I'm really glad we did.  I had it in my hands after just a moment of careful thought.  

LOVED IT!  You earn one of our favorite points for the day.  I'm so glad we stopped.  Thanks for the fun.

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Cords posted are the trail head only.  Not the actual cache.  YOU MUST DO SEARCHING ON THE GEO-WEBSITE BEFORE DOING THIS CACHE!
  First jot down the trail head cords.  Then find the closest Benchmark nearest them. Once you have that, proceed to the find this very old style Benchmark. The area immediately around Benchmark can be slippery.  There are also thorns and vines growing up very near area. If you park in the church lot, you do NOT have to cross the road.  
  Once you found it, the cache is EXACTLY 53' on a magnectic bearing of 30 degrees.  North - north east from Benchmark.  If you can not figure this bearing, look in a circle 53' away!  Cache is a small LocK/Lock with cammo tape.  
 I enjoy Benchmarking almost a much as Geocaching.  This style is very old and few of these exist.  The are several along this path.  Another about 1 mile east, and one on the bridge just off County Rd 4 on the same path going west.    I hope you enjoy this.  Please look out for muggles walking and hide as good or better than found.  Do not leave it exposed to be found by others non cachers please!


Congradulations to 72CCT-ChE for another FTF!!!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I pass by here on my way to Geneva more times than I could ever count, and have always wanted to stop for this one.  I had already done my "homework" quite a while ago, and today was a perfect day to hopefully move this over into the found column.

Had a great walk on the nice trail and soon found myself in the general vicinity of the benchmark.  I tried the coords on the benchmark page first which took me to a spot that didn't match what I had read in previous logs.  On my way back to the trail I stumbled upon the cache.  Sweet!  Signed in and replaced as found.

Never did find the benchmark.  The more accurate coords provided by the CO pointed right into a patch of thick growth, so I decided to return some day in the fall when things have died back a little.  Never seen one of these bolt types, so I'd like to check it out.

Thanks for the fun puzzle and hide!</groundspeak:text>

I made plans to meet a group near here, but when I ended up car pooling, I left the benchmark coords in my car.  . . oops.  I had a pretty good idea what to look for from the pictures, and also because we found several similar benchmarks further down on the trail, but I used the PAF connection to confirm my suspicions.  We found the benchmark with ease, and then I made quick work of the final. . . last of the day.  Thanks for the fun.</groundspeak:text>

Blackbox was a game invented in the early 1970s by Eric Solomon. (He got his inspiration for the game from Godfrey Hounsfield, the British researcher who invented the CAT scanner.)  The game consists of sending "beams" into a square box via any of the 8 "ports" on each side.  One of three things can happen to the "beams".  They can:&lt;br /&gt;
- strike an "atom" directly and be absorbed&lt;br /&gt;
- glance off one or more atoms and be reflected back&lt;br /&gt;
- come out another port, possibly being reflected along the way&lt;br /&gt;
The objective is to deduce the locations of the atoms by the behavior of the beams.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can try playing the game &lt;a href="http://www.bibeault.org/blackbox/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Note that on this website, the atoms are referred to as "balls".&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If the above website is down or you want a further explanation, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Box_(game)"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is the wikipedia web page for the game.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To solve the puzzle, you'll have to find the atoms contained in two blackboxes based on the clues shown below.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is located at:&lt;br /&gt;
N42 &lt;a href="http://www.drivehq.com/file/df.aspx/publish/bridgebum/PublicFolder/N%20coords%20for%20blackbox.pdf"&gt;ab.cde&lt;/a&gt;   W77 &lt;a href="http://www.drivehq.com/file/df.aspx/publish/bridgebum/PublicFolder/W%20coords%20for%20blackbox.pdf"&gt;vw.xyz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Not as easy as my test run examples, but even more fun because I really had to think about it instead of just "asking" for another square to be filled in for me on the website games.  Soon enough, I had coords.  Planned on heading to do some caches in the general area today after breakfast, so MacCrew and I started here.  Very nicely laid out multi on a very neat trail, and we had no difficulty coming up with each hide. Thanks BB and DD, another great puzzle and equal quality hide!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Pep and I were heading down south this morning after breakfast and she had solved this last night, so this was our first stop. I vowed not to log it until I solved it, so got home, played the online version a few times and thought I'd give the cache puzzle a try. Easier than I thought it would be and I was pretty sure I had it, but got a "Sorry" from the GeoChecker. Hmm... As it turns out, I transposed 2 numbers when I wrote them down. Checked again and got the "Congratulations" message. Yay! So now I can "legally" log it. Enjoyed the walk along a trail I'd never been to before. Found all the waypoints with no problem, including the final. Thanks for a fun puzzle and tftc. :)</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">4th stop of the day on my puzzle run between Ithaca and Rochester in hopes of having the GeoRoc picnic event be cache #999 for me.  Everything worked out great and I had a lot of fun.  I enjoyed solving the puzzle when it came out, as it was a kind of logic puzzle I had never seen before.  I seem to remember it took me a little work to do it right, but that may be because I hadn't read the rules completely.  I was a little hesitant to tackle a 3 stage multi by myself, but had no problems at all.  Sometimes it seems my geopals make most of the finds when we go out, so it was encouraging for me to be able to do this one totally on my own.  Waypoint one had me grinning.  I understood the reference from having done &lt;a href="http://coord.info/GCX30K"&gt;this cache&lt;/a&gt; a while back, but didn't find exactly what I was expecting.  Waypoint two turned out to be very well camoed, but had it in hand before too long, and was off to waypoint three where I found the nicely hidden (and very large) black box.  Lots of nice swag in there, but I took/left nothing.  Signed in and was on my way. Thanks for another fun puzzle and cache.  [:)] P.S. Great meeting up with the CO's at the picnic!</groundspeak:text>

As he mentioned, we made very quick work of this cache.  We felt like the geo caching kings after this one.  We got knocked off our pedestals at the next Battleship cache we did though.  It felt good to be on top for a little bit.

A good puzzle and a nice hide, thanks for the fun</groundspeak:text>

This part of the trail has a narrow strip in the middle made of fine crushed coal. The cinder and crushed coal mix makes this for easy walking and biking.&lt;br /&gt;

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">This cache is located along the Ontario Pathways trail system. The terrain rating is for the distance from the given parking.&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Ontario Pathways is a well maintained trail that was an old railroad bed. As you walk or bike along the trial you will see remnants of this railroad bed including ties, bits of coal, culverts and even benchmarks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthracite is a hard compact variety of mineral coal that has a high luster. You may see some pieces of this along the trail at some places. When you are walking along this section of the trail you will cross some fairly new bridges. There are several places where you will see a lot of moss cover railroad ties or dead trees. Some deer trails cross the trails and you may also see some stumps of trees that were chewed down by beavers. There is also an Old Pin Style benchmark on the bridge nearby. See Related Web Page for details. You will be looking for a cylinder container about 2 inches diameter and 4 inches long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please bring you own pen or pencil.&lt;/p&gt;

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Ontario Pathways is a well maintained trail that was an old railroad bed. As you walk or bike along the trial you will see remnants of this railroad bed including ties, bits of coal, culverts and even benchmarks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are walking along this section of the trail you will cross some fairly new bridges. There are several places where you will see a lot of moss cover railroad ties or dead trees. Some deer trails cross the trails and you may also see some stumps of trees that were chewed down by beavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please bring you own pen or pencil.&lt;/p&gt;

There’s peace and quiet, beauty and repose
It’s hidden in a valley beside a mountain stream
And lying there beside it
I find that I can dream "

Those are lyrics from a camp song we used to sing years ago and for some reason when I visit the small cemeteries, it always comes to mind. They may not be "hidden in a valley beside a mountain stream" but they are peaceful places to me.  I have enjoyed finding some of the small graveyards that others have brought me to while caching and I wanted to share a few of the ones I have found.

This is one of the two I go by on my way to visit my mom in Canandaigua. It is listed as the Tilton or New Michigan Cemetery and there are only a few graves. Enjoy the quiet while you look for the cache.  Please do not search after dark.

Cache container is someplace between small and a micro. Please rehide it carefully. The grounds here seem well kept up and it could easily be discovered if left exposed. There was a pencil when I hid it but bring one to be sure.

   <groundspeak:short_description html="False">New cache. New cords.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache is placed along the Ontario Pathways. It is near the location of odhome’s  archived “Together” cache,  which had a unique container, but unfortunately it was muggled and archived.  So, to give this area a new cache, I have placed “Together Again”.  This new cache is a small cammoed lock and lock, but big enough for small trackables.  Park on Smith Rd. or Freshour Rd. Should be a nice walk along the pathways and an easy find.  

Congratulations to Captain Jon for another FTF and to zekechili and daughter for STF!</groundspeak:long_description>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Seedling tribute cache for TheTilleyHat who recently celebrated the big 1,000! This cache was provided by The Pink Panthers for those that were the first few to find &lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=629b465e-8650-4644-9afa-e0584c3b104d&amp;amp;log=y&amp;amp;decrypt="&gt;GC2T573&lt;/a&gt;. Congratulations Tilley on a job well done!</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">TTH = The Tilley Hat. Not only is the Tilley Hat a great hat but the Tilley Hat is also a great cacher! I've run into Tilley on a few occasions in the field and recognized him right away due to the attire. Every time I see a Tilley Hat for sale somewhere I think of Tilley. While this started out with a matchstick container provided in tribute to TTH, it went missing and I had to replace the final with a bison tube. But TTH is still honored and has completed this cache...even if he did need a hint! ;) This is a short two part multi that will bring you to a small town park in Farmington, NY. I tried my hardest to obtain the best coordinates possible but you might find WP1 will keep you going around in circles while you search for the next clue. Please be careful on the terrain! Farmington Grove Park is open from 6am - 10pm daily. Please don't cache between 10pm - 6am! You may also find many small muggles in the area which may delay your find. You may enter the park on the East, North, West, and my personal favorite the South side of the park. The east side has a parking lot available. All the others may require parking along the road. If you park along the road make sure it doesn't conflict with seasonal snow removal parking regulations in place in Farmington. The park does have public rest rooms and a drinking fountain available but not for all hours that the park is open or during all seasons. Please bring your own pen/pencil for signing log. Congratulations to WAM86 on FTF!
&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
    <groundspeak:encoded_hints>WP1: You've a 1 in 6 shot of finding this on the first try. Take the path most worn (you don't have to get wet if there is water!). You are looking for a very strong computer hard drive magnet with the coords of WP2 written on both sides with a sharpie and covered with tape to make it last. You should be able to read in place without removal. But if you must remove the very strong magnet, please be careful putting it back and in the same orientation and location.

WP2: Hmmm. I think most adults could find this one. Others might need a boost. Please secure container well as sometimes water can pool here.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

After a bit of looking I found it on the ground under the tree on the opposite side that it should have been about 2-3' away. Not sure how this new container could have "dropped" from the "pool". It is now back in a "pool" that might be a little smaller and a little lower to the ground. Let's see if that helps. You should be able to find upon your return to sign the log.

The cache is a small lock and lock, with some room for trackables.  Shouldn't be too difficult to find. Hope you enjoy the nice view from the cache. Just be careful during hunting season.

FTF gets a dollar coin. 

Another big congrats to Captain Jon for FTF!

We enjoyed this site, my wife who is "high challenged at 5'4.5" (and yes that half inch is important!),
spotted the deer stand, saw that it was "looking OVER" and climbed that rickety old ladder for a look.
Did she find the cache?  No Comment!  I will say she did not see any Deer - Oh Dear!

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Ontario Pathways is a well maintained trail that was an old railroad bed. As you walk along the trail you will see remnants of this railroad bed including ties, coals, culverts and even benchmarks. The cache you are looking for is a plastic Vitamin bottle about six inches long and three inches in diameter. The opening is only about two inches so there is room for small swag.&lt;br /&gt;
Depending on what time of the year you go, you may see HOMEW. If you don’t see HOMEW, you still will be able to get to the cache.&lt;br /&gt;
The original HOMEW and Replica both went missing.To see others like HOMEW, click &lt;a target="_ blank" href="http://californiabricksociety.com/index.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is located in Meeting House Park in the town of
Farmington. The park is on the northwest corner of the intersection
of County Road 28 and Shortsville Road.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Meeting House Park is a very small town park. It has a nice
stand of tall pine trees, a picnic table, and an upright stone
marker. The park is CLOSED from 10pm to 6am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache container is fairly small, so only the very tiniest of
trade items might fit. It has started out with a log book, pencil,
and a couple of very tiny trade items. I even managed to cram in a
little token for the first-to-find. PLEASE re-pack the cache
carefully as it's a tight fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is some historical information on the park:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The park was turned over to the town on July 4, 1976 as a part
of the 1976 national bicentennial observation. The stone marker was
originally located three miles north of its present location in the
park. In 1928 it was moved to the present location by the Herendeen
Association and a plaque was added. The grove of evergreen trees
was also planted at that time.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Should have known what I was looking for here but hadn't paid much attention to the hiders as I traveled down the trail.

Bounced around to a few likely hiding spots and finally got to the right area for finding the cache. Almost let the name through me from initial thoughts but found the first idea was the correct one.
 
Spotted the cache, signed in and replaced without seeing and muggles during my whole time on the trail.

Thanks for the stop.</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The White Tail Hills is a nice, little settlement about 15 minutes far away from downtown Canandaigua.&lt;br /&gt;
There is a lot of deer and interesting birds out there, for example Cardinals, in the woods that you can &lt;br /&gt;
observe. When you are done with logging the cache, I highly recommand to take a nice walk through &lt;br /&gt;
the settlement. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The geocache is an easy find and also for beginners. Please don't forget to close the cache correctly. The cache was hidden with admission of the owner of the private property.</groundspeak:long_description>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">A nice flat walk along a wide path on an old railroad bed which is now the Ontario Pathways.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">As you walk or bike along this trail you will see remnants of the old railroad bed. Some chunks of cinder and coal can still be seen if you look down at the trail as you walk along. Maybe even an old spike in a tie. Enjoy the scenery and wildlife too as you make your way to the cache. Benchmark on the way to this cache at: N42 52.555 W077 12.327 Old pin style on south side of trail. (Where creek runs under the trail). See Related Web Page for more details.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A rail spike is a large nail with an offset head that is used to secure rails to railroad ties in the track. Robert Livingston Stevens is credited with the invention of the railroad spike, being first used in at least 1832. The most famous spike of all is the Golden Spike which is the ceremonial final spike driven to join the rails of the First Transcontinental Railroad across the United States on May 10, 1869. I don’t think you will see one of those along the old railroad bed though.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please obey private property signs along the trail. Please bring your own pen or pencil as the container is not big enough to have one.&lt;br /&gt;

Also look at some of the remnants of the railroad bed along the way. Traditionally wooden ties on the railroad bed were usually made from oak but today concrete is now widely used. Approximately 3000 ties are used per mile of railroad track. Now you will know why you may see piles of ties along the trail.&lt;br /&gt;

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The winter of 2012 - 2013 was long and gray. We coped with the early winter of 2013 by turning our backs on it. Solving puzzle caches was a good way to keep warm and dry and entertained. Cache puzzles posed by sujojeepers and mcdurr in California and Bumble! in Massachusetts were particularly challenging and educational. Each puzzle we solved was based on a different cipher from this American Cryptogram Association list. Click &lt;a target="_ blank" href="http://www.cryptogram.org/cipher_types.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Now we want to share the fun with you by placing some ACA cipher caches in the Finger Lakes area. Good luck and have fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is not at the posted coordinates. You must solve the puzzle to get the coordinates. There are two one dollar gold coins for the first two solver/finders. Please bring your own pencil or pen.&lt;/p&gt;

So I solved this some time ago and just couldn't make it out this way.  I enjoyed the puzzle, although it took some time and work to get through. Thank God for Excel....

I asked my wife if she wanted to go for a walk since we had both been sick for a week and needed some fresh air.  So off we went.   About halfway to the cache we saw something coming out of the ground. When I saw it I decided to keep moving...fast.  My wife screamed and went into a panic. I thought I was going to have to carry her. I am not sure what they were, but they sure looked like the picture I attached. I have never seen them before and don't want to again!  The good thing is it was only a 30 ft section of trail that had the holes in the ground...

So we finally made it to GZ without any stings and I soon had the container. Signed in and headed back to the car.  I had taken a mental note of where are friends were and when we got to GZ2 I told my wife 'stay in the center and move fast'.  She did and we were home free!

This was a fun old school pencil/paper and brain puzzle.  I appreciate the time and effort you put into the puzzle and hide (yes, I like the spot you chose and I know why you chose it!).

Thanks for the brain exercise and the fun hike. Hopefully the cooler weather will knock those nasty bugs out of the way.

We may not be first to solve or first to find, however we (mostly jfw) eventually work our way to solving the puzzle, finding the cache and signing the log. This was our fourth stop on an epic DeltaDelta sign the log day. Thanks for the fun!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Third puzzle on my puzzle run between Ithaca and Rochester as part of my plan to hit cache #999 at the GeoRoc picnic tomorrow.  I had solved this one when it came out (I admit it, I used a tool to do the heavy lifting), and was looking forward to coming and making the finds.  As chief puzzle instigator over the winter, it is really gratifying to me to see these caches appear and see how much fun folks have been having doing all of them.  I'll try to get my act together to put out another one in Ithaca before long.  I had a very pleasant walk to the cache, and spotted it in the 2nd place I looked.  Signed in and was on my way to the next one.  Thanks for the puzzle and the cache! [:)]</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This cache is along the Ontario Pathways trail.  It is not meant to be difficult, just fun.  A great place for walking, bike riding or even cross country skiing. Should be a nice adventure for the whole family. Trail is open from dawn to dusk.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Cache container is small, but larger than a film canister. Not much room for trackables. Bring your own pen or pencil. Should be winter accessible.

A word of caution: the trail narrows as it goes over a culvert at N42 52.663 W077 11.101, and there is a drop off.  Please watch your young children at this point. Otherwise this is a great walk for the whole family.

Parking at either of the crossroads.  Enjoy!

Congrats to Captain Jon for another FTF!

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">This is an easy 4 part multi which will take you around the
Hopewell Burying Ground, otherwise known as the Hopewell Pioneer
Cemetery.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">OK, Henry Flagler
(&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Flagler"&gt;biography&lt;/a&gt;)
didn't exactly invent Florida, but he arguably did more to make it
a vacation destination than anyone else in history! He built
railroads around the state and fine hotels for people to stay in.
So what does that have to do with this cache? Well, Henry was born
here in Hopewell, and WP1 is a sign commemorating that fact. &lt;br /&gt;
Let A = the two digits of the Boy Scout Troup added together &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Head on over to WP2. Teenagers drinking beer are frequently the
cause of headstones toppled over in cemeteries, but not always!
Sometimes, unevenly settling soil causes stones to lean and finally
topple over. You will see several examples of this as you wander
around this cemetery. WP2 takes you to the monument for Hiram and
Lucy Ann. Even though the bottom section of this monument is a
massive stone, likely laid on top of a base of crushed gravel or
concrete, it is slowly tilting (as is another large monument next
to it). It is quite possible that within 100 years, this large
structure may be in pieces on the ground.&lt;br /&gt;
Let B = the first digit of the day of the month that Hiram died
in.&lt;br /&gt;
Let C = the numerical value of the month Lucy Ann died in.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Now take a short walk to WP3. On the way there, you may notice
several older stones that have been repaired or modified to reduce
the chance of breakage. WP3 is the headstone of Thomas Miles. This
stone has been repaired with a couple of iron straps. That's
working for now, but there are other examples nearby where similar
repairs have failed.&lt;br /&gt;
Let D = the numeric value of the month Thomas died in.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The final is located at:&lt;br /&gt;
N42 51.ACD W77 12.XAB &lt;br /&gt;
where X=C-A&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Daylight hours only! And please be respectful of the area.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">It's The Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown...another classic Peanuts show.  That pumpkin patch was spooky and Linus seemed crazy for spending the night there!  This hidden place reminds me of the pumpkin patch.  It's historical, hidden, but quite abandoned now.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The third in our PEANUTS GANG SERIES will have you wandering around a goulish area.  Please be respectful here as this place is old. Dawn to dusk caching.  Be sure to rehide the cache better than you found it so that the next cacher will be equally as challenged! Congrats to FTF DirtDigger Bridgebum TheTilleyHat!&lt;br /&gt;

A word of caution: the trail narrows as it goes over a culvert at N42 52.663 W077 11.101, and there is a drop off.  Please watch your young children at this point. Otherwise this is a great walk for the whole family.

As I approached the search area, dove in on a geotrail but found it didn't produce what I was looking for. Followed the GPSr slightly further to where it originally wanted me to be and was quickly rewarded by spotting the uncovered cache. Cache was in good shape. Signed in and replaced better than found.

Come to find out that the old cache got "McChewed On" and obviously became a home for small woodland creatures. Cache was replaced today and a new log book installed. 

* Please re-close the container well and return all contents to their stuff bags, in fear of future break-ins *

This place seems to be crowded only one time per year! It's a nice little niche with a great scene and a very short well groomed trail. 

The cache is a plastic container with items collected from McDonalds over the years! Feel free to exchange any small items you wish! I will try to keep it stocked over time.

Wow, was I wrong!   

Cache was in good shape, but holy geo-trail, batman!  I just realized while logging how old this cache is.  Good job keeping it alive!!  Took: Hello Kitty sticker; Left: Friendly Rock.   Thanks for the McFun.

Also of note:  The two TBs that are listed in the cache (Oliver Owl and Shuttle Bug), are obviously not in the cache.  You may already know this, but the cache owner has the ability to mark them as missing.</groundspeak:text>

Good caching to you.  Always play it safe, to geocache another day.

Please!  Be sure the container is sealed completely.  It may be a bit difficult to close, so be sure the top clicks completely into position.  This will keep the logbook from getting wet.  Thank You.</groundspeak:long_description>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Cache container is a small plastic cammoed tube, about the size of a film canister.  No room for trackables. Bring your own pen or pencil. Should be winter accessible.



A word of caution: the trail narrows as it goes over a culvert at N42 52.663 W077 11.101, and there is a drop off. Please watch your young children at this point. Otherwise this is a great walk for the whole family.
 
Trail is open from dawn to dusk and would also be a good place for biking or cross country skiing. Or come and enjoy the hike.

I realized when I got home that if I waited until tomorrow I could have used this as a Birthday cache challenge cache. h well, I was here and had fun.  I really enjoyed this new area and had a great time exploring. Nice job on the cache, it's in great shape.

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The cache container is a small cammoed plastic tube with no room for  trackables. Best to bring your own pen or pencil. Easy enough to find, hopefully even in the winter.


A word of caution: the trail narrows as it goes over a culvert at N42 52.663 W077 11.101, and there is a drop off. Please watch your young children at this point. Otherwise this is a great walk for the whole family.

Trail is open from dawn to dusk and would also be a good place for biking or cross country skiing.

Congrats to Potter Trekies for FTF!

Geo-Coins are a hobby of mine.  Some have Pirates, some have Nautical themes, some are puzzle solvers.  To get the sipher for this cache, you will have to find the coin I used to  come up with the puzzle.  The sipher in the coin description is not from the coin. You should be able to figure it easily.  Same theme or way to use the sipher is the same to set the coin up to use.

Congradulations to Bridgebum on the FTF!!!!

I was aiming for the event to be cache #999 and it all worked out great. [:D]  I had solved this puzzle a long time ago, but never been in the area before, so when deltadelta1 heard I was going to be out around here, he encouraged me to stop and do this cache.  I'm glad he did, as I enjoyed the nice walk in on the trail.  Saw a little bitty snake slither across the path, and a frog hopped by (I seem to notice more of these things when caching by myself!) Made the find without any trouble (loved the container) and was on to the next one.  Thanks for the puzzle and the cache! [:)]</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache takes you on a walking tour of part of the historic
village of Bloomfield, NY. It is an easy walk of approximately one
mile in length, virtually all on sidewalks. Although it does not
have you cross the busy highway, please be careful when crossing
local streets. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 The listed coordinates are suggested parking for this cache. 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="LongDescription"&gt;The historical information for this
cache is taken from a walking tour put together by the East
Bloomfield Historical Society. Please visit their &lt;a rel="nofollow"
href="http://ebhs1838.org/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; for further
information.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The first waypoint takes you to a historic marker. Let A be the
last two digits of the year that the French explorer La Salle
passed through the area. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 The second waypoint brings you to a pale green home. This house
was originally built by Philo Hamlin as a store in 1796. Let B be
the number of freestanding posts supporting the front porch.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 The next waypoint carries you to a location which was once known
as "The Farmers' Store". This Federal style brick building was
constructed between 1808 and 1812 by a group of local farmers as a
co-op store. Let C be the street address of the building. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 The final waypoint takes you to a beautiful Italianate home with
Gothic style barn constructed by Charles Page in 1870. Mr. Page was
a prosperous hops farmer. As you look at the home from the street,
notice the small barn behind and to the right of the home. This was
one of Mr. Page's hops barns. Let D be the number of windows in the
barn which face the street. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 The location of the final is: N42 53.XY W077 26.Z&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
 Y=A+2&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Z=C-B-8&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is a camouflaged decon container. It is on private
property, but we have permission to hide it there. But daylight
hours only please!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And finally, in keeping with the historic theme of this cache, the
FTF prize is an 1863 Patriotic Civil War Token. During the Civil
War, there was a shortage of circulated coins because of hoarding.
Private mints satisfied the need for one cent coins by creating
tokens that were put into circulation and treated, for a time, as
legitimate coinage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Congratulations to TazD for another FTF!</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I had my bike but decided that if this was a walking tour, then I would walk it. I enjoyed exploring the village and learning about all the history. Once I had the coordinates though, I was unsure about where I was going. I knew this was on private property but these put me in someone's garden. I looked for thirty seconds and then got too uncomfortable and walked away. I will confirm my coordinates and maybe return some time in the future.

Thanks for showing me a new area, I had a great time.  Cache is in great shape and what a nice spot!

Thanks for a fun puzzle and a nice cache location. It feels good to be finding some of these puzzles I have solved and getting them signed.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We really enjoyed solving this puzzle. Needed a cache today, so we headed this direction and decided to tackle it. We parked about one and a half mile from it and then enjoyed a very pleasant walk today. Yesterday's snow was still clinging to the branches which made for a wonderful, peaceful scene. By coming from the direction we chose, we needed to cross a little stream. At first it appeared to be frozen over, but I proved that wrong! After finding the cache, we found a better way back. Thanks for the fun, bridgebum.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Suzy solved another one! She is getting real good at this. I printed the sheet of dominoes and cut them out last night. I spend a few minutes shuffling them around and gave up. Later that evening Sue was proudly pointing at the solved puzzle.

I went out this morning to claim our latest prize, and the satellites were being creepy to me. I paused on the trail and started waving my GPS around. It's a good thing no one was around. It must have looked like I was blessing the forest. When I finally got a lock, I noticed I was only forty feet away. After a short search, I was signing the log. Thankfully there was a pencil in the cache. I forgot my pen again. [:o)]

Thanks again for another fun puzzle and geocache. By the way, did I mention that I cut out the dominoes?

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The Ontario Pathways trail is built on abandoned railroad beds. Although the rails are no longer here there are remnants of them along the Ontario Pathway.  I watched modern machinery replacing ties and rails a few years ago along some active lines but some things still had to be done by brute strength. I found out that these workers are still called Gandy Dancers but  machines do most of the work.
   Gandy dancer is a slang term used for early railroad workers who laid the rails and ties by hand.  There are various origins of the term Gandy dancers but it is still most popularly known as the men who did the difficult physical work of track maintenance under the direction of an overseer. There are lyrics and songs they sang as they worked to keep in cadence with handling the rails or driving the spikes. Read about Gandy dancers and as you walk along the trail try to picture the scene of crews laying the rails and singing the songs.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">The cache itself is in great shape.  This cache needs the EASY kind of maintenance - one you can do from the comfort of your own home.  We're just asking that you please update the coords on this cache.  The ones previous finders have given you are good:
N 42° 57.952 W 077° 13.707

Simply do a log entry (as if you have found a cache), but choose "update coordinates" as your type of log entry.  Easy as anything.   Then I would suggest doing a second log choosing "owner maintenance" and that will remove the red flag this entry of mine has put on your cache.  That's all there is to it!  Future finders = happy.

One more thought - If I had a container like that, I would be proud to call it a "regular" instead of a "size not chosen".  That you would do under "edit" near the top right of the cache page.  Some may be more apt to look for your cache if they know it has swag and TB potential.  Just a thought . . .

Thanks, again, for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

East Victor Road and Brace Road in Victor, NY.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Parking and the trailhead can be found on East Victor Road at N
42 58.029 / W 077 22.654. You &lt;b&gt;will&lt;/b&gt; have to cross a creek
along the way. It is very shallow and easy to cross in the summer,
but may be impassable when the water is higher. &lt;b&gt;Please use good
judgement when deciding whether to cross it.&lt;/b&gt; You do not need to
cross the second creek as the cache is on the east side of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check out this exceptionally nice and detailed web site
about the Auburn Trail and all its sections [&lt;a href=

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;NOTICE:&lt;/font&gt; The trail is bordered on
both sides by private property, please be respectful and stay on
the trail. Also, be careful walking this trail during hunting
season.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be careful not to be spotted by any nearby golfers.
That's part of the challenge of finding this cache. It's entirely
possible depending upon the direction you approach the cache
from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache's name comes from the fact that it started out life
stocked with tools of various sorts. Feel free to trade whatever
sort of items you like. I'll reload a few theme items whenever I do
maintenance on the cache. Signature items and travel bugs are
always welcome, of course!&lt;/p&gt;

I started here, and found all waypoints and the final quickly.  Very well done, I believe that this was my first journey on this section of the trail.

Used to try to avoid multicaches but certain owners make them a great fun experience, including you.  Nice waypoints, and a nice straight walk.  Sure enough we saw walkers, joggers and 1 biker.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Papyrus" color="#000080" size="4"&gt;The cache lies in
Onanda Park, which is located on West Lake Road, 7 miles south of
Canandaigua. Onanda Park's history dates back to 1919, formerly
camps for the YWCA and Camp Good Days and Special Times. The park
consists of 80 acres including cabins, pavilions, playgrounds,
fishing access, a beach and upland hiking trails with great views
of the falls. The free parking area is reached by going up the
drive on the west side of the road opposite the main
entrance.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Papyrus" color="#000080" size="4"&gt;The trail to the
falls and the cache starts under the wooden sign "Upland Hiking
Trail" we recommend you follow the trail keeping to the right until
you reach the end of the trail. After finding the cache reward
yourself with a downhill return walk and views of the
falls.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Papyrus" size="4"&gt;&lt;font color="#000080"&gt;The cache
container is a 30 mm box packed full of trade items. It is well
hidden and in order for all cachers to have a good hunt&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#FF0000"&gt;RETURN THE CACHE AS YOU FOUND
IT.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;About Captain Diana...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An excerpt from the entry on Captain Diana in &lt;u&gt;Wild and
Strange Women of New York&lt;/u&gt; by Terese Harrington and Drusilla
Howe, Comari Press, May 1998.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Diana Elsbeth Verhulst was born in New Amsterdam in
1634. She was the eldest of the seven daughters of Peter and Lina
Verhulst. Peter Verhulst worked for the Dutch West India Company as
a trader and fur merchant. He often traveled through the
territories and provinces that now overlie New York and
Pennsylvania trading for furs with the indigenous Native American
peoples. Following the wild call of her heart, Diana more than not
accompanied her father on these trading expeditions. As such, she
garned a list of uncommon skills: hunting and wilderness survival,
herbal medicine and lore, conversant in several Native American
languages, and a stunning knowledge of every waterway, lake, and
river in New York and Pennsylvania.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Diana, like her mother and sisters, had a deep and
unabiding love for all botanical pursuits. While traveling with her
father, she collected not only seeds and roots to bring back to her
mother and sisters but also collected plant and medicinal knowledge
from the people she and her father traded with. Diana's mother and
sisters used the plant material and knowledge Diana brought back to
grow plants and prepare medicines for the other Dutch colonists as
western-styled medicines and preparations were expensive and half a
world away. Lina and her daughters were highly valued members of
the community."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An exerpt from Roger Pickman's &lt;u&gt;Buccaneers of Western New
York&lt;/u&gt;, Golden Goblin Press, 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Captain Diana Elsbeth Verhulst was Western New York's
Grande Damme buccaneer. Her unconvential upbringing gave her an
intimate knowledge of the waterways in New York. Her pirating
career began as a privateer during the Anglo-Dutch Wars. She
commanded numerous different vessels that attacked English military
and merchant vessels throughout the New York and Pennsylvania
waterways.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Captain Diana one was of the most feared of the Western
New York pirates. What struck fear in the hearts of the European
captains most was that she crewed her ships with mainly the angered
and ill-treated First Nations peoples of the New England, Central
Atlantic, and Great Lakes regions. Her crew was fiercely loyal and
attacked with seemingly no fear. She and her crew were well-liked
and supported by the other First Nations peoples of the areas in
which she sailed -- often sharing the booty and goods from the
ships they attacked with these people.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Diana was noted for striking without warning and
disappearing back into the mists without a trace. Her most famous
attack was when she was captaining the ship White Hawk on the
waters of Canandaigua Lake. In the early hours of a misty October
morning she attacked the English ship Resolute near Squaw Island.
The survivors remember a mist-choked fall morning and an eerie
drumming sound rising up from the lake depths. On the heels of the
lake drums the White Hawk burst forth from the mists, cannons
blazing. On the third volley the powder magazine of the Resolute
was hit. The burned hulk of the Resolute is still visible on calm
mornings at the bottom of Canandaigua Lake."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK103Q1 - Parking&lt;br /&gt;N 42° 47.067 W 077° 18.935&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">"Found it" = *gasp* replaced the cache.   **ducks**

This has not be found for 9 months and maintenance was requested four months ago after four incredible experienced cachers all claimed DNFs.  So I figured my choice was 1) help or or 2) request archive.  I decided that the first approach was more cacher friendly, though my partner of the day, Raggedy Andy, was leery.  I take full responsibility, but it was a container he had in his geo-bag that saved the cache.   Part of my decision was based on the fact that this cache has been around since 2008?!  That seems to be a rarity, so let's keep it alive.

The cache is still a nano- but it is NOT magnetic.  It is well hidden and totally findable, though.

Thanks for the fun and Happy Caching!</groundspeak:text>

NO, no wait, that's not true.  We saw a tree completely coated with this insect shells.  Seriously!  My husband took one look at them and knew they were cicadas.  I learned the following (Wikipedia, of course):

"Cicadas live underground as nymphs for most of their lives . . . In the final nymphal instar, they construct an exit tunnel to the surface and emerge. They then molt (shed their skins) on a nearby plant for the last time and emerge as adults. The exuvia, or abandoned exoskeleton, remains, still clinging to the bark of trees."

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache requests your participation with a NASA and USGS Citizen Science project. As with all geocaches, you are under no obligation to participate in the study to log this find. Choosing to contribute to this study will require you to take 6 photographs and answer a few simple questions. Should you decide not to participate in the study, you may still log the cache (but you won't be nearly as cool in my book.). Thanks for your understanding.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Landsat&lt;/strong&gt; represents the world's longest continuously acquired collection of space-based moderate-resolution land remote sensing data. Nearly four decades of imagery provides a unique resource for those who work in agriculture, geology, forestry, regional planning, education, mapping, and global change research. Landsat images are also invaluable for emergency response and disaster relief.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As a joint initiative between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and NASA, the Landsat Project and the data it collects support government, commercial, industrial, civilian, military, and educational communities throughout the United States and worldwide.  The Adopt-A-Pixel Program is being conducted by NASA, the U.S. Geological Survey, the NASA/USGS Landsat Team, and their partners:&lt;br /&gt;
·         4-H&lt;br /&gt;
·         The New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science&lt;br /&gt;
·         Bandelier National Monument, US National Park Service&lt;br /&gt;
·         Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail, US National Park Service&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The eighth and most recent Landsat Satellite was launched February 11, 2013.  Like its predecessors, this satellite will be providing images with 30-meter resolution, making a complete revolution of the earth approximately every 24 hours.  Each pixel on the image represents approximately 30m on the ground.  Pretty remarkable, considering these satellites are hundreds of miles above the earth.  It would be something similar to seeing three blades of grass from the other side of the football field!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Landsat Science Team has the job of understanding these data so they can know and tell other people exactly and specifically how our planet is changing over time.  For many reasons, the scientists need to check the satellite data with observations made by people on the ground in order to have the greatest possible confidence in the accuracy of their work. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That’s where you come in. Your observations can contribute significantly to the value of the satellite data for national and global agriculture, climate, disaster management, ecosystems and biodiversity energy, fire, forest management, human health, urban growth and more.&lt;br /&gt;
NASA and the USGS are inviting citizen scientists across the world to Adopt a Pixel.  So, I’ve created this geocache so that you can help NASA observe this 30m pixel of space on an ongoing basis!  While Geocaching has removed the “Additional Logging Requirements”, I am hoping that you will choose to help out (in addition to claiming your smiley!) this project by taking a few extra minutes to fill out the “Data Sheet” in the log book.&lt;br /&gt;
You will need to be able to take six pictures in order to complete the data sheet, so be sure to have some sort of a digital camera (cell phone camera, tablet camera, point and shoot, SLR, etc…) with you.  When you find the cache, use your camera to take the following images (be sure to take them in sequence:&lt;br /&gt;
·         One image, facing North&lt;br /&gt;
·         One image, facing East&lt;br /&gt;
·         One image, facing South&lt;br /&gt;
·         One image, facing West&lt;br /&gt;
·         One image, facing up to the sky&lt;br /&gt;
·         One image, facing down to the ground.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;There are some critical ground rules for these images:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Landscape Photos:&lt;/strong&gt;  Your photographs should be in landscape format, not in portrait (they should be longer than they are tall).  Views that are not too distant will be best (such as far off mountains).  At the same time, we will not be able to use close-ups such as tree trunks.  Somewhere in between is what we need.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Level:&lt;/strong&gt;  Make sure that your images are as level as you can.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;No People: &lt;/strong&gt; Please do not include any people in your photographs, unless they are unrecognizable. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Modifications: &lt;/strong&gt; Please do not modify your photographs in any way before submitting them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ownership:&lt;/strong&gt;  Once you have uploaded the pictures, they will become public domain.  Photographers should have no assumption of ownership.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Landsat Satellite Overpass: &lt;/strong&gt; Photographs taken at the same time as the Landsat Satellite is passing overhead will be particularly useful.  Typically, the satellite passes over this location at approximately 10:30am daily.  You can still participate, even if you find this cache at another time, but pictures taken around 10:30am are most useful for the scientists.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once you have taken these six images, please take a moment to fill in the Data Sheet which is provided inside the cache container.  It is a little more involved than a typical log sheet, but it won’t take any more than 5 minutes to help out NASA. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When you log this cache online, I will ask you to please email your six images to the cache owner (jah249@cornell.edu).  I will collect the images, and will periodically replace the log book.  I will submit all of the data and the images to NASA on a monthly basis. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

It is located on private property and has been given permission by the owners. Please give a friendly wave if you happen to see them.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">In travelling about the world and exploring local cultures, I've always been amazed that we, as humans, hope to be remembered by raising elaborate monuments or markers above our graves. In many cases, the ravages of time and weather obliterate the carvings upon the stones and leave no indication of who lies beneath.

A CASE IN POINT is the Case family, early settlers of Bristol in the 1800's, who were buried in a cemetery that bears their name. Of the 8 recorded burials, only a couple of grave markers are still legible, James Case and his wife Betsy. As to the others, who knows? If you explore further, you'll find nondescript stone markers of at least 5 more.

The cache is a 2 quart cammo-painted plastic jar with a screw lid. The cache is NOT close to any gravestone, so please respect the site and DON'T search around them! Visit the site, grab the cache, say a word of thanks to our forebearers and respectfully depart.</groundspeak:long_description>

This is about a 1.5 mile round trip hike from the parking coords.   Its a nice flat hike through an open apple orchard and part of the Victor Hiking Trails system.

From the parking coords go North of the building and follow the yellow blazes and victor hiking trail signs.

On the hill to your right after a bit is where we thought we saw a coyote.  We're not sure what it was, but Barkley went crazy when he picked up the scent.

My son helped place this decon and it should be an easy find.  I believe the trail splits past where we put the cache, and there is another cache just past it aways.

There is a Chilehead coin for FTF.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I've driven by the apple farm a number of times but never stopped.  This morning that finally changed.  What a great place this is to go caching!  The only thing I regret is that I didn't choose a better day to experience this one.  (Doh!)

I stopped in the building first to buy a cup of coffee before I set off down the trail.  The wind definitely reminded me that winter is on its way, but I still had a great walk regardless.  Enjoyed the views of the orchard despite the gray skies and the rain, and was soon at GZ.  Absolutely no problem finding the cache (which is in great shape), and I was quickly signed in and on my way back to the car.

Thanks for putting this one out there and for pointing out this spot to me.  I will be back again to explore on a nicer day!</groundspeak:text>

&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="green"&gt;-Have you ever picked up a trackable that has been in one area for too long?&lt;br /&gt;
-Do you have a trackable that has not been to any southern states?&lt;br /&gt;
-Would you like your trackable to take an epic journey?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="orange"&gt;If so, Then you have found the right place. Wormholes are shortcuts, connecting distance points in space and time. You have just found our end of the Wormhole that transports your coins and bugs directly to a cache in North or South Carolina. Our cache in NY works in conjunction with two Wormhole caches (1 in NC and 1 in SC - both located at Welcome Centers on opposite sides of the same highway) to transport trackables back and forth other through the wormhole. Here are links to the other ends of the wormhole (N.C.- &lt;a href="http://coord.info/GC3PGFC" target="_blank"&gt;GC3PGFC&lt;/a&gt; and S.C.- &lt;a href="http://coord.info/GC3PP5K" target="_blank"&gt;GC3PP5K&lt;/a&gt;). We liked the cache containers so much we used the same ones for each end of the wormhole.....If you would like your trackables to take a journey out of town simply place them inside this cache.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;Our guidelines for these caches are:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1.) The wormhole is a one way ticket for ALL trackables placed in this cache. Once dropped, it will travel through the wormhole and come out the other end in a cache somewhere in North Carolina or South Carolina. **Each trackable will be dipped in one of the two wormhole caches at the other end so it formally records going through the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2.) We check the caches weekly to make sure the trackables move fast through the wormhole. We devised a system for the "transport" that has been tested and is very reliable.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3.) Please remember to log the trackables you drop as soon as possible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="red"&gt;**PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE ANY TRACKABLES FROM THIS CACHE!!......If you DO NOT want your trackable to travel Southbound DO NOT drop it in this cache.**&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="green"&gt;This cache is located close to a Park-N-Ride Lot just OFF The New York State Thruway. Northbound and Southbound traffic from the Thruway can access this cache quickly by getting off at EXIT #44. Parking coordinates have been provided. If not traveling via the Thruway you can come from several directions, Loomis Road, Plastermill Road, or Rochester Road.(RTE. #332)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This area can become very busy at times so please be aware of muggles. Use stealth BEFORE and AFTER searching for this cache. The container has a logbook, pens, and can obviously hold trackables.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
**DIRECTIONS FOR OPENING &amp;amp; CLOSING THE CACHE: Please make sure to close the cache tightly and secure it with the lock provided. The latches work smallest to biggest and vise versa when opening and closing the container. To open the lock you must line up the combination with the name written in black lettering on the lock. The combination must remain in place for the lock to close. After you close the lock, PLEASE spin the combination so the lock stays locked. We have taken great care so this cache will remain at its location, please do the same. We know there have been issues in the area with caches, that's also why we made this a "premium member only cache".&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Congrats goes out to: StrivingforCamelot on his FTF&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As always we name our caches after song titles. "Southbound" is one of our favorite songs from a incredible band we both love, "The Allman Brothers".&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Watchout for an influx of southern state trackables in the area, they just might have come through this wormhole.....&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
*A special thanks goes out to Blaze for all his help, and to "The Band of Cachers" who have graciously accepted us as Charter members of the New York Chapter.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Parked in the nearby area and headed into the cache.    It was any easy find, but unfortuanately (for the cache) the lock was broken and I could access the logbook without a problem.    There were no TBs in the enclosed container either, even though someone has dropped one off in the last week or so.

      <groundspeak:finder id="714325">Sapience Trek</groundspeak:finder>
      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Greetings!

I noticed that your cache has the needs maintenance attribute set.  This is generally caused when a cacher posts a "needs maintenance log on  your cache for a number of reasons.  If you have addressed the issue or believe there is no issue, you can remove this attribute by posting an "owner maintenance" log, or editing the attribute list to remove it (note on caches other than traditional, the needs maintenance icon does not show, but clicking "Update Attributes" will clear it anyway.)

Often people will filter out caches that require maintenance so making sure this is correct will help cachers find your cache.

If you haven't addressed the issue, go out and find a few caches and fix this one on the way back!  [:)]

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">This is easy walk along one of the Victor Hiking Trails.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">In thinking of the caches I like the best they fall into a few
categories - sometimes it's the challenge of the find, sometimes
it's the nice long walk in the woods and sometimes it's just going
to an interesting place. This is the latter.
&lt;p&gt;This is an easy walk along one of the Victor Hiking Trails. As
always, the length is dependent on where you end up parking. Once
you get to the cache you have pretty scene with a view of what the
cache is named after. Makes for a very nice photo op IMHO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache itself is decon container with a few small trade
items. You will need to bring our own pen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FTF gets a pin that I recently got at a NATO event in Norfolk. I
think it's pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">In November 2008, Captain Jon found a USGS Benchmark. That
alone&lt;br /&gt;
isn't such a big deal, but THIS Benchmark was different. This
was&lt;br /&gt;
Jon's 100th Benchmark. There aren't a lot of people who spend a
lot&lt;br /&gt;
of time looking for Benchmarks, so Jon's achievement is
notable.&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is placed in recognition of this achievement.&lt;br /&gt;
Congratulations, Captain!</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is based on &lt;strong&gt;Benchmarks&lt;/strong&gt;.There are three
stages to this cache, representing three different types of Marks.
These are NOT official Marks, but are replicas of these markers.
There are many different types of marks, and the following
(summarized) rundown is provided on the Geocaching webpage:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;A benchmark&lt;/b&gt; is a point whose position is known to a
high degree of accuracy and is normally marked in some way. The
marker is often a metal disk made for this purpose, but it can also
be a church spire, a radio tower, a mark chiseled into stone, or a
metal rod driven into the ground. Over two centuries or so, many
other objects of greater or lesser permanence have been used.
Benchmarks can be found at various locations all over the United
States. They are used by land surveyors, builders and engineers,
map makers, and other professionals who need an accurate answer to
the question, "Where?" Many of these markers are part of the
geodetic control network (technically known as the National Spatial
Reference System, or NSRS) created and maintained by NOAA's
National Geodetic Survey (NGS).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt; 
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Kinds of Benchmarks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 Benchmarks can be divided into two general groups. The first
group, "vertical control points" are objects that mark a very
precise elevation above the standard datum plane (usually referred
to as elevation "above sea level"). The second group are the
"horizontal control points" - objects with precisely established
latitude and longitude. At this point, we should explain that
"benchmark" is a generic term that is used here at Geocaching.com
to refer to all geodetic control points. In the surveying
profession, however, the term bench mark (usually two words) is
used specifically for points of known elevation, or vertical
control. When the benchmark is established at known latitude and
longitude, it is described as horizontal control. The generic terms
favored by professionals to describe horizontal control are station
or mark, rather than "benchmark".&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Vertical Control Marks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
These are the true "bench marks". Generally the words BENCH MARK
will be printed on them near their rim if the mark is the disk
type. Many vertical control marks are not the disk type, however,
and can include bolts, rivets, chiseled squares, chiseled crosses,
etc.&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Horizontal Control Marks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There are several types of horizontal control marks. They differ by
which kind of horizontal control system was used in establishing
them and the amount of precision they represent. Most horizontal
control marks are marked with a disk, but some are other types such
as a chiseled cross, bolt, drill hole, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;Intersection Stations&lt;/b&gt; (a Type of Horizontal Control)&lt;br /&gt;
An intersection station is a prominent landmark, such as a water
tower, radio tower, church spire, mountain top, or any other type
of object that can be observed from a distance. These kinds of
"large object" station markers, known as intersection stations
because of the way their coordinates are calculated are usually
landmarks higher in the air than any surrounding objects, which
allows them to be seen from many miles away in several directions.
By observing one or more such points through a telescope, surveyors
can determine positions on the surface of the Earth through the use
of trigonometry.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Triangulation Stations&lt;/b&gt; (a Type of Horizontal Control)&lt;br /&gt;
A triangulation station is usually a metal disk with a small
triangle in its center Generally the words TRIANGULATION STATION
will be printed on them near their rim. Its position has been
determined by measuring distances and angles from other stations.
Triangulation stations, also called tri-stations, are typically
associated with nearby reference mark disks and an azimuth mark
disk. More about that below.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;Other Types of Horizontal Control&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;There are several
other types horizontal control marks. These include traverse
stations, trilateration stations, and GPS stations and often those
words are printed around their rim. Generally these horizontal
control marks are not associated with reference marks or azimuth
marks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Reference Marks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 Triangulation stations usually have two or more reference marks
associated with them. Reference marks are for helping to keep the
location of triangulation stations from being lost and are not
actually geodetic control marks. The triangulation station's
description has accurate azimuth and horizontal (not slope)
distance to each of its reference marks so that it can be re-set
from them if necessary. These marks also have arrows in their
centers that are supposed to point toward the triangulation
station. A few reference marks are surveyed with adjusted
coordinates and have their own PID in the database.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Azimuth Marks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 An azimuth mark, together with its associated triangulation
station, provides an accurate azimuth (like a compass direction)
that is based on true North rather than magnetic North. This
azimuth is used to orient local traverse surveys. These marks also
have arrows in their centers that are supposed to point toward the
triangulation station.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;Cadastral Marks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 Some disks that look like benchmarks exist principally to mark
land boundaries. These marks, called cadastral marks, are actually
not vertical or horizontal control (geodetic) marks. However, some
of these marks are in the database because surveyors have made use
of them for geodetic control purposes without having to monument a
new benchmark in the area.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The hike is about 1 mile round trip, on railroad grade.
The&lt;br /&gt;
higher terrain rating is based on the immediate terrain around
each&lt;br /&gt;
waypoint.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We were glad to be able to find all parts of this cache.  It was our first attempt at trying to do the necessary calculations, but after one clearly wrong solution (56 miles away) we realized our error and soon had the cache in hand.  The container is leaking and had water in it, so the CO may want to replace it (and the log).  Thanks for the education - this was a great cache!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:finder id="2863104">rushrutter</groundspeak:finder>
      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well we had tried this one exactly 2 months ago. That day was a very cold and windy one and although we found WP1, we struck out on WP2. We were caching in the area today and drove right by here. It always annoys me to see the cache icon on my Nuvi, especially ones that we have DNF'ed, so we HAD to stop and try again. It was a very nice afternoon so we knew we would not have weather as our excuse this time! We made our way to where we had left off before, spent a good(?) 30 minutes looking everywhere but still not making the find. 
We really hate it when we are consistent with our inability to find a cache so we decided to see if we could use our geosense and the info as to how long the round trip is to find the final without the coords. It was such a nice day that we did not mind the walk and even though there were LOTS of promising hiding spots - and we checked most of them - we eventually found what we were looking for!!
It's better to be lucky than good. Especially if it results in a smilie. So at least the cache won't show up on the car's GPSr as we drive by, even though I will still wonder what we missed at WP2. TFTC</groundspeak:text>

When we got back to the truck we saw why we were cold, it was only 12 degrees and with the wind the way it was, we don't even want to know the wind chill! We will be back on a better day.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I had searched here before and got as far as WP2. I couldnt find it and continued down the trail. I found a benchmark over the weekend and it inspired me to take another shot. I read the logs and was planning on winging it at the final like a few others before me had. After 45 minutes, that didnt work so I returned to WP2 and found what I needed pretty quickly this time. I went down the trail the OTHER DIRECTION of my previous search and found the final in minutes. Im glad to have this smiley. TFTC</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This cache is located in Harlan Fisher Park. The primary entrance is located off Lynaugh Road and tucked in between residential homes, be careful not to miss it.  The park has picnic tables, a playground and trails to enjoy.  Please be aware the park is open dust to dawn.  However, it recently under went a renovation and the entrance gate has been intermittently closed.  You can park and attempt this cache regardless of the gate opened or closed.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">We name all our caches after song titles.  This one is an oldie but a goodie from the band "The Yardbirds".  They were part of the British 60's rock invasion and had a few members in the band that went on to become  very famous.  You might recognize a young Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck from the background picture we posted. 






Things To Remember:

-The cache is located in the park, please respect the neighboring private properties.

-Loud Dogs Barking:  Do not be alarmed by this, yes we know they are there and yes they do make noise...

-Please take great care in replacing the cache EXACTLY as you found it.

-Container only holds a logbook and room for very small trade items.  You MUST bring your own pen to sign log.

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache will take you to the Dryer Road Park / Fort Hill area in Victor. The coordinates shown are for the highest point on Fort Hill. They have nothing to do with the cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Imagine that you're standing on Fort Hill. Let's say you've got a slingshot, you find an appropriate stone, and you fire it south toward Rt. 41. Your assistant (you did bring one with you, didn't you?) video records this moment and calculates that you fired the stone at an initial speed of 145 feet/second at an angle of 48 degrees above the horizon. He or she also determines that the stone landed at a point 140 vertical feet below it's starting point. Assuming no air resistance (and a gravitational constant&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt; of 32 feet per second per second), you will need to find two numbers:&lt;br /&gt;
t = the time (in seconds) the stone was in the air&lt;br /&gt;
d = the horizontal distance (in feet) the stone travels before hitting the ground&lt;br /&gt;
Once you have those numbers, the cache can be found at&lt;br /&gt;
N42 57.X W077 26.Y where&lt;br /&gt;
X = 7504/t (rounded to the nearest integer) and&lt;br /&gt;
Y = d/2 (rounded to the nearest integer)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now, don't you wish you stayed awake during that high school physics class?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is quite near an existing trail. But be careful when leaving the trail, as we've seen old barbed wire in several places, including near the cache!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dryer Road Park is open from dawn to dusk. Please do not attempt this cache during other hours.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt; if you use 9.8 meters/sec/sec instead, Evince will still verify, but you'll be roughly 35 feet off.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://evince.locusprime.net/cgi-bin/index.cgi?q=Gp3h1E3PfQKE92xSgDR-Snx1vLB283xNIuA"&gt;&lt;img src="http://evince.locusprime.net/images/evince-logo_sm.png" border="0" alt="Click to verify coordinates" title="Click to verify coordinates" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We were going to give a slingshot as a FTF prize, but we were concerned you'd hurt yourself (or someone else). So instead the FTF prize is a "Flingshot Flying Cow". Way better!&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Woo Hoo!  I worked on this puzzle last night and FINALLY had success.  I have looked at this one at different times ever since we started caching and just had no luck.  Physics is definitely not my strong suit.  After taking a peek at the hint, and stumbling with a few mistakes, I eventually had the congrats on the geochecker.  This was the only cache not completed in our 20 closest to home.  So happy to have it solved.  We went out with the 5Cs today to make the find.  What a workout!  It was all well worth it.  Thanks for bringing us to a new part of the park that we had not yet explored and TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

Today after getting a FTF on a different Bridgebum cache, we ended up over here, and had a quite breezy (and cold) walk to the cache area.

Today we arrived at GZ and after 5 minutes of searching and a muggle and her dog approaching, we decided to move on, expecting to need to DNF this one. But when we got back, and no one around, we gave it another try and managed to find the well hidden coords. We still had some time, so we headed to the final and like many others, took the bad approach to the final. The fresh snow made it a bit tougher to find but not too bad. TFTC</groundspeak:text>

Took the very hard way to the final(found the easy way on the way out).  Made the find and discovered no log. I carry extras in baggies so I signed and added it to the container.  It is small and looks out of place, but it's a log.

BLUES" - Geocaching Series&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;The cache is
starting off with a log book,pencil, and is large enough to hold
trackables. Parking is available and even though the sometimes the
gate is closed you can still park and walk in.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;This is the
fourth cache in our "Don't Get The Blues" - (DGTB) series. The
theme is very simple. In this area, winter caching can become quite
unnerving at times, and leave you with "The Blues". This series of
caches has been designed to allow everyone to find caches during
the winter months and not leave you "Feeling the Blues"&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The
only rules that you must remember are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The
caches are all winter accessible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The
cache title will begin with DGTB - and have a song title with
"Blue" in it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The
cache can be found regardless if there is 3ft. of snow or no snow
at all.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;Every cache
will present it's own challenges as to how it will be found...some
will be quite easy, others will be harder....In the end we hope
this will sustain everyone through the winter months until the
frost breaks.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;As always we
name our caches after song titles. "Bullet the Blue Sky" by U2 had
to make the list. Its such a great song from one of our favorite
bands.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;This cache is
located in Harlan Fisher Park and depending on the time of year, it
can get wet and muddy...wear boots.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;For the FTF we
have left a FTF Banner.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I done caches all around this one, but I never seemed to get this one.  Today, we were in the area, and finally we made the stop.  We caught a couple of teens being friendly in the park.  They jump a bit as we approached. 
Had to do a little bushwhacking, and mud walking, but eventually we got there.  Found same nice blackberries nearby too.
No winter blues here.
Thanks</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="14" color="blue"&gt;"DON'T GET THE
BLUES" - Geocaching Series&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;The cache is
starting off with a log book and a pencil. The container is large
enough to hold trackables. Park in the adjacent parking and begin
your search.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;I must give all
the credit to the creation of this cache series to my
wife.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;This is the
first cache in our "Don't Get The Blues" - (DGTB) series. The theme
is very simple. In this area, winter caching can become quite
unnerving at times, and leave you with "The Blues". This series of
caches has been designed to allow everyone to find caches during
the winter months and not leave you "Feeling the Blues"&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The
only rules that you must remember are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The
caches are all winter accessible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The
cache title will begin with DGTB - and have a song title with
"Blue" in it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The
cache can be found regardless if there is 3ft. of snow or no snow
at all.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;Every cache
will present it's own challenges as to how it will be found...some
will be quite easy, others will be harder....In the end we hope
this will sustain everyone through the winter months until the
frost breaks.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;As always we name
our caches after song titles. "Tangled Up In Blue" is the third
cache in this series and seems appropriate for this crossword
puzzle cache.&lt;/font&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Great cache! I had fun with the puzzle and I have to say I really enjoyed the hide. As soon as I hiked in to GZ I saw what needed to be done.  This was very creative and I love creative caches!

Thanks for being a part of a great day out caching. I took some time today to grab some caches I have been meaning to get and also grabbed a few puzzle caches I solved long ago and never grabbed. Feels god to have this one done. 

Log was a bit damp but I had no problems signing it.  In this heat it will probably dry right up. I couldn't believe how hot it was today.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Don't do many puzzles, but ElbaPatch needed something unique for his 13,000th and this was the one picked.  Once at GZ had no problem finding the hide having seen this type of container several times before. Thanks for the cache.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well after trying to get to my next milestone for the past month, today was the day. Had worked on this puzzle for a long time and had finally solved it but with a bad knee wasn't able to do any geocaching for awhile. Received a cortizone injection so with the knee strengthened, off we went. Only needed one before making this puzzle the 13,000th find. SUCCESS! GOAL ACHIEVED! Now the schedule the knee replacement. Thanks for the cache even though I don't like puzzles.
