      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">After one of our regular members told us that he would not be able to make it this week, we asked another cacher if he wanted to join the Tuesday Caching Crew this week. We agreed to head over to Stewart Forest for the day and bring the bikes. We had a good day riding around the park and managed to find 50 caches while we were here. Only a couple of DNFs for the day. Thanks.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">The Tuesday Cache Crew (TCC) returned to the forest. 
Today, myself, Marbleguy and Waiwij returned with our bikes. We rode @15 miles and found @50 caches. It was a beautiful day for riding and until the afternoon, we didn't see anyone else out here. Thanks all for the hides.
Waiwinji found it about 45FT from GZ.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">So today I was out with the Tuesday caching Crew TCC, which today consisted of Firefighter Skippy, MarbleGuy and I, we were out to conquer more of Stewart Forest. All logs signed as TCC.
The day started out quite cool with temps in the mid 40’s which made for great biking weather. Our course took us both on the semi paved roads as well as on rough trails, which made for great biking variety.
Caches types and placements were awesome varying from difficult to easy, nano’s to ammo can.
Total haul for the day was approximately 50 with about 3 or so DNF’, not a shabby day.
As usual I will not discuss details of any cache to maintain the surprise for others.
Many thanks to all cache owners, for placing and maintaining these caches.
Cache on

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Decided to cache Stewart Forest for a little bit this morning before heading to my sisters.  Searched for this one twice. After giving up the first time I was heading back to the car and passed this one again. I read that the co-ords are off and was hoping for a prior log with some better readings. Nope. So I just started to search for a hiding place for an ammo can. I found in short order. I am posting my reading for others. TFTH</groundspeak:text>
