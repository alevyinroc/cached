      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">There are many such "places" in New York State, but this one is unique for a very special reason. Every state in the Union has one of these, but only "one", not two or more.  Sorry, it is not the state's capitol.

Geocachers often visit these "places".  The coodinates will take you very close to this place, but you may have trouble getting there; however the sign will tell you why this place in unique to the State of New York.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">1) Please do NOT indicate what type of place this is or why it is unique in your "found it" log.  And please do not post any photos to give it away.

2) You may post your find immediately after finding out what type of place it is and why it is unique, but you must also email me upon posting telling me the uniqueness of the location.

Hope I have you wondering just what this place could be. Despite what some maps may show you shouldn't have to get wet.</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We dropped by here on a beautiful sunny afternoon, just before having dinner at the nearby bistro in the wine center.  There were a bunch of people fishing right at GZ, but it was easy to gather the required info - a big advantage of virtuals, as getting a physical cache here would've been impossible without being observed.  Thanks for keeping this one going.</groundspeak:text>
