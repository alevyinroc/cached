   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">This is a three part multi. It is a mostly flat walk of roughly a mile in total. The final is a large ammo can (black of course) filled with trade items.&lt;br /&gt;

Blackbox was a game invented in the early 1970s by Eric Solomon. (He got his inspiration for the game from Godfrey Hounsfield, the British researcher who invented the CAT scanner.)  The game consists of sending "beams" into a square box via any of the 8 "ports" on each side.  One of three things can happen to the "beams".  They can:&lt;br /&gt;
- strike an "atom" directly and be absorbed&lt;br /&gt;
- glance off one or more atoms and be reflected back&lt;br /&gt;
- come out another port, possibly being reflected along the way&lt;br /&gt;
The objective is to deduce the locations of the atoms by the behavior of the beams.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can try playing the game &lt;a href="http://www.bibeault.org/blackbox/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Note that on this website, the atoms are referred to as "balls".&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If the above website is down or you want a further explanation, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Box_(game)"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is the wikipedia web page for the game.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To solve the puzzle, you'll have to find the atoms contained in two blackboxes based on the clues shown below.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I have actually had this one solved for a couple weeks now.  Had a lot of fun learning on the webpage, and then took my shot at the puzzle itself. Not as easy as my test run examples, but even more fun because I really had to think about it instead of just "asking" for another square to be filled in for me on the website games.  Soon enough, I had coords.  Planned on heading to do some caches in the general area today after breakfast, so MacCrew and I started here.  Very nicely laid out multi on a very neat trail, and we had no difficulty coming up with each hide. Thanks BB and DD, another great puzzle and equal quality hide!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Pep and I were heading down south this morning after breakfast and she had solved this last night, so this was our first stop. I vowed not to log it until I solved it, so got home, played the online version a few times and thought I'd give the cache puzzle a try. Easier than I thought it would be and I was pretty sure I had it, but got a "Sorry" from the GeoChecker. Hmm... As it turns out, I transposed 2 numbers when I wrote them down. Checked again and got the "Congratulations" message. Yay! So now I can "legally" log it. Enjoyed the walk along a trail I'd never been to before. Found all the waypoints with no problem, including the final. Thanks for a fun puzzle and tftc. :)</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">4th stop of the day on my puzzle run between Ithaca and Rochester in hopes of having the GeoRoc picnic event be cache #999 for me.  Everything worked out great and I had a lot of fun.  I enjoyed solving the puzzle when it came out, as it was a kind of logic puzzle I had never seen before.  I seem to remember it took me a little work to do it right, but that may be because I hadn't read the rules completely.  I was a little hesitant to tackle a 3 stage multi by myself, but had no problems at all.  Sometimes it seems my geopals make most of the finds when we go out, so it was encouraging for me to be able to do this one totally on my own.  Waypoint one had me grinning.  I understood the reference from having done &lt;a href="http://coord.info/GCX30K"&gt;this cache&lt;/a&gt; a while back, but didn't find exactly what I was expecting.  Waypoint two turned out to be very well camoed, but had it in hand before too long, and was off to waypoint three where I found the nicely hidden (and very large) black box.  Lots of nice swag in there, but I took/left nothing.  Signed in and was on my way. Thanks for another fun puzzle and cache.  [:)] P.S. Great meeting up with the CO's at the picnic!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I solved this one some time ago but never made it out here.  Sase and I were out caching and I suggested we stop.

As he mentioned, we made very quick work of this cache.  We felt like the geo caching kings after this one.  We got knocked off our pedestals at the next Battleship cache we did though.  It felt good to be on top for a little bit.

A good puzzle and a nice hide, thanks for the fun</groundspeak:text>
