&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#FF0000"&gt;TO FIND THE CACHE YOU

SEARCHING&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Papyrus" color="#000080" size="4"&gt;The cache lies in
Onanda Park, which is located on West Lake Road, 7 miles south of
Canandaigua. Onanda Park's history dates back to 1919, formerly
camps for the YWCA and Camp Good Days and Special Times. The park
consists of 80 acres including cabins, pavilions, playgrounds,
fishing access, a beach and upland hiking trails with great views
of the falls. The free parking area is reached by going up the
drive on the west side of the road opposite the main
entrance.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Papyrus" color="#000080" size="4"&gt;The trail to the
falls and the cache starts under the wooden sign "Upland Hiking
Trail" we recommend you follow the trail keeping to the right until
you reach the end of the trail. After finding the cache reward
yourself with a downhill return walk and views of the
falls.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Papyrus" size="4"&gt;&lt;font color="#000080"&gt;The cache
container is a 30 mm box packed full of trade items. It is well
hidden and in order for all cachers to have a good hunt&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#FF0000"&gt;RETURN THE CACHE AS YOU FOUND
IT.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This is a great cache and very well hidden.  We started our hike at the lower parking lot and were the only 2 people on the mountain.  The walk to the trail from the parking lot was steep, but once on the trail, it was much better.  There are some really nice resting stops if needed and some nice overlook points.  Once we reached the location of the cache, it took awhile for us to actually find it.  I had to look at a few pictures in order to find the cache and it still took a little while.  As a matter of fact, my wife and I had decided to head on back since it was getting late.  I decided to stop one more time at the location we initially thought it was near, and that is when I finally found it!

Very beautiful place with some wonderful scenery so be sure to take your camera.  Remember that the entire return trip is DOWN HILL!!!

I instead spent my time before I had to go to work exploring more of the trails. Your legs will get a workout before you get to the woods, but pretty flat once you're there.

It was getting close to lunch time and Mud Dancer, Grandzero, astryintheforest and I had been on the go since 7am.  We were hungry and tired, but upward we went.  The call of a cache drove us on.  We were rewarded with great views of the area and a new smiley.  Thanks for the adventure!</groundspeak:text>

Accompanied by odhome, astrayintheforest &amp; MudDancer we polished off a dozen caches before lunch. An original Wheelygood cache....how nice. The upward climb was challenging but we were rewarded with some nice views and a smilie.

Quiet up here today so did not worry too much about it. The view from the one platform was worth the hike. Looks like a nice place to camp as well. TFTC</groundspeak:text>
