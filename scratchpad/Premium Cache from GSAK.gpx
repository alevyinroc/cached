&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="green"&gt;-Have you ever picked up a trackable that has been in one area for too long?&lt;br /&gt;
-Do you have a trackable that has not been to any southern states?&lt;br /&gt;
-Would you like your trackable to take an epic journey?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="orange"&gt;If so, Then you have found the right place. Wormholes are shortcuts, connecting distance points in space and time. You have just found our end of the Wormhole that transports your coins and bugs directly to a cache in North or South Carolina. Our cache in NY works in conjunction with two Wormhole caches (1 in NC and 1 in SC - both located at Welcome Centers on opposite sides of the same highway) to transport trackables back and forth other through the wormhole. Here are links to the other ends of the wormhole (N.C.- &lt;a href="http://coord.info/GC3PGFC" target="_blank"&gt;GC3PGFC&lt;/a&gt; and S.C.- &lt;a href="http://coord.info/GC3PP5K" target="_blank"&gt;GC3PP5K&lt;/a&gt;). We liked the cache containers so much we used the same ones for each end of the wormhole.....If you would like your trackables to take a journey out of town simply place them inside this cache.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;Our guidelines for these caches are:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1.) The wormhole is a one way ticket for ALL trackables placed in this cache. Once dropped, it will travel through the wormhole and come out the other end in a cache somewhere in North Carolina or South Carolina. **Each trackable will be dipped in one of the two wormhole caches at the other end so it formally records going through the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2.) We check the caches weekly to make sure the trackables move fast through the wormhole. We devised a system for the "transport" that has been tested and is very reliable.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3.) Please remember to log the trackables you drop as soon as possible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="red"&gt;**PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE ANY TRACKABLES FROM THIS CACHE!!......If you DO NOT want your trackable to travel Southbound DO NOT drop it in this cache.**&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="green"&gt;This cache is located close to a Park-N-Ride Lot just OFF The New York State Thruway. Northbound and Southbound traffic from the Thruway can access this cache quickly by getting off at EXIT #44. Parking coordinates have been provided. If not traveling via the Thruway you can come from several directions, Loomis Road, Plastermill Road, or Rochester Road.(RTE. #332)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This area can become very busy at times so please be aware of muggles. Use stealth BEFORE and AFTER searching for this cache. The container has a logbook, pens, and can obviously hold trackables.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
**DIRECTIONS FOR OPENING &amp;amp; CLOSING THE CACHE: Please make sure to close the cache tightly and secure it with the lock provided. The latches work smallest to biggest and vise versa when opening and closing the container. To open the lock you must line up the combination with the name written in black lettering on the lock. The combination must remain in place for the lock to close. After you close the lock, PLEASE spin the combination so the lock stays locked. We have taken great care so this cache will remain at its location, please do the same. We know there have been issues in the area with caches, that's also why we made this a "premium member only cache".&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Congrats goes out to: StrivingforCamelot on his FTF&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As always we name our caches after song titles. "Southbound" is one of our favorite songs from a incredible band we both love, "The Allman Brothers".&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Watchout for an influx of southern state trackables in the area, they just might have come through this wormhole.....&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
*A special thanks goes out to Blaze for all his help, and to "The Band of Cachers" who have graciously accepted us as Charter members of the New York Chapter.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We have a couple of caches like this one home in Australia, so I was looking forward to making the detour while heading from Niagara to Albany.    Parked in the nearby area and headed into the cache.    It was any easy find, but unfortuanately (for the cache) the lock was broken and I could access the logbook without a problem.    There were no TBs in the enclosed container either, even though someone has dropped one off in the last week or so.

A great container and fun to find.....just hope all is ok with it.   Fav point added...</groundspeak:text>
