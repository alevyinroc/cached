The weather today was cool, with on and off rain,  Fast cache and dash while traveling through the general area.   . I would like to thank all the cache owners who kept these caches maintained for this trip full of smiles. especially ROCKY for keeping this cache available for everyone to experience. Caches that can be found are good caches! TN SLAMO</groundspeak:text>
