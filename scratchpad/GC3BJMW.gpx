   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="14" color="blue"&gt;"DON'T GET THE
BLUES" - Geocaching Series&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;The cache is
starting off with a log book and a pencil. The container is large
enough to hold trackables. Park in the adjacent parking and begin
your search.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;I must give all
the credit to the creation of this cache series to my
wife.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;This is the
first cache in our "Don't Get The Blues" - (DGTB) series. The theme
is very simple. In this area, winter caching can become quite
unnerving at times, and leave you with "The Blues". This series of
caches has been designed to allow everyone to find caches during
the winter months and not leave you "Feeling the Blues"&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The
only rules that you must remember are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The
caches are all winter accessible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The
cache title will begin with DGTB - and have a song title with
"Blue" in it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The
cache can be found regardless if there is 3ft. of snow or no snow
at all.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;Every cache
will present it's own challenges as to how it will be found...some
will be quite easy, others will be harder....In the end we hope
this will sustain everyone through the winter months until the
frost breaks.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;font face="comic sans ms" size="4" color="blue"&gt;As always we name
our caches after song titles. "Tangled Up In Blue" is the third
cache in this series and seems appropriate for this crossword
puzzle cache.&lt;/font&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This puzzle proved that 2 brains are better than one. I started solving it before our trip begun and never finished, I took the print out with me and during breakfast today we Nik's help I was able to come up with the final coords. Very cool. Thanks!</groundspeak:text>

This puzzle had our temperature heating up.  Jo.b and I solve this over breakfast our hotel.  Once with workable coordinates, we took the quick trip out to this cache to find this one a couple others close by.
Nicely done and lots of fun.
Thanks!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Great cache! I had fun with the puzzle and I have to say I really enjoyed the hide. As soon as I hiked in to GZ I saw what needed to be done.  This was very creative and I love creative caches!

Thanks for being a part of a great day out caching. I took some time today to grab some caches I have been meaning to get and also grabbed a few puzzle caches I solved long ago and never grabbed. Feels god to have this one done. 

Log was a bit damp but I had no problems signing it.  In this heat it will probably dry right up. I couldn't believe how hot it was today.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Don't do many puzzles, but ElbaPatch needed something unique for his 13,000th and this was the one picked.  Once at GZ had no problem finding the hide having seen this type of container several times before. Thanks for the cache.
