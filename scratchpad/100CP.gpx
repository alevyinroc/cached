   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wow!!! ChiliPepperD wasted no time and posted the FTF 25
minutes after publishing! Congrats!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Dylan wanted to do this as a memory of the first cache we
found&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;center&gt;So about two and a half years ago, I had heard about
Geocaching from a few different places and people. At a Cub Scout
meeting, one mom was saying that it would be a good thing for the
boys to do as one of their requirements next year. A little hike,
outdoors, a change of pace from a regular meeting. So before
embarking on a journey with nine six year olds, I figured that I
should do 'searching' into what this geocaching thing was all
about.&lt;br /&gt;
After googling and reading about how it all began - &lt;a href=
"http://www.geocaching.com/about/history.aspx"&gt;Check here if you
don't know!&lt;/a&gt; - and thought it sounded pretty cool.&lt;br /&gt;
But wait! The only GPS I had was a Garmin Nuvi 200 that I had
bought for "Mrs. Zinzah" when we left Long Island to move
"Upstate".&lt;br /&gt;
Would it work? Well, I found &lt;a href=
"http://www.geocaching.com/"&gt;geocaching.com&lt;/a&gt; (see Google
reference above!), typed in my ZipCode and found that there were
several caches very close by. I was amazed at how many there
actually were with just a few miles of home! There were even a
couple in my neighborhood!!&lt;br /&gt;
I noted the co-ordinates on a piece of paper and tucked it in my
wallet. A couple of days later, we were on our way to a school
function for Dylan and, as we were leaving the neighborhood, I
pulled over, grabbed the Nuvi, and punched in the co-ordinates. We
jumped out of the car and headed in the direction it said. I didn't
take very long until Dylan said "Is this it?" It was!!! We opened
it and I showed them the log and we signed it....Our first "Seek
and Find" as I called it when I logged the find.&lt;br /&gt;
Now a couple of years later, we have a Premium membership, a Dakota
10 (Happy Birthday to me!) over 150 finds (yeah, yeah, were getting
there....) in 6 states, an FTF - shhh..don't tell Dylan! - he
almost had his FTF last weekend here &lt;a href=
"http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=ac8024f5-beb6-4235-9f90-c8661222fe88"&gt;
Light Up Your Life&lt;/a&gt; and try and get out every weekend.&lt;br /&gt;
Both kids are into it and 'discuss' who gets to find it, sign it
and put it back..New rule is the Finder gets to do it all...Helps
with the motivation to look everywhere!!&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway, I recently noticed that Evan had archived his "Egg-cellent"
series and Dylan was sad about that. So here is a replacement in
memory of the First one of &lt;b&gt;EVAN'S EGG-CELLENT ADVENTURE&lt;/b&gt;
series.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please bring your own pencil as this hide is a small Bison tube
with barely enough room for the log!&lt;br /&gt;

Redhead has expanded her monitoring westward. We have to confess that we weren't sure if these babies would be successful, so we put them out under another name to get impartial feedback. It seems cachers have liked the Redheads and to boot we got some suggestions about the right glue to use. Thanks everyone!</groundspeak:short_description>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Chipper, one of the Pullstring Boys and a roadie on the Guitar Guys geo-entourage, loves to play ball. He was named after his Atlanta Braves hero, Chipper Jones while he was batting .400! This cache was hidden near the baseball fields where the Guitar Guys spent many seasons and made several hits of their own, including a walk-off game winning hit, a walk-off championship winning hit, and one unbelievable out of the park long ball in the upper quad!


During baseball season be sure to dodge the long balls and evade the muggles!

Cache is a small container with a log book, pen/pencil and variety of small swag. Please be sure to close cache tightly and re-secure carefully. 

The Guitar Guys and their roadies, the Pullstring Boys hope you enjoy Chipper's Long Ball 2!</groundspeak:long_description>

It really blends in well, it took a few minutes to locate it and a few more to plan my way in to grab it. TFTC</groundspeak:text>

This was their second cache attempt of the day having given up on Snappy as traffic at that locatipn was flying by and the cache didn't reveal itself immediately.  The GPSr brought us directly to the right place and Frak had it in hand almost before Frin got there.  We signed right under our kids, the Geosliders.

&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;This Wherigo Cache will have you
searching Clifton Commons for 5 signs.  With the exception of
walking 100 feet for the final (the geocache element) this
Wherigo can be done without leaving your car making it a good rainy
day Wherigo/Geocache.  The Cartridge will show you
pictures of the signs but will not tell you where they are. Its
your job to find the signs the best way you can.   If you
know where they are you’re in luck.  If not ask someone or
just drive around the park until you spot them.  When you get
close to one of signs the cartridge will notify you then ask a
question easily answered when you are in front of the sign.  
After all 5 signs have been found the final zone will be turned
on.  At the final zone is a bison tube with a key word on the
top of the log.  You will need that keyword to complete the
cartridge.&lt;/div&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Here we go again! Another reall cool R.O.J. Wherigo. Billdavidsaurus planned a really cool day of Wherigos and this fell right in with the plan. We needed a break from himking all over the place and this cool guy was perfect. 
We cruised all over the park...searching out the signs needed. Some were easy to spot while others were a little more challenging. In the end, we managed to locate every one and soon we were off to the final.
Here, my android took a fall. Rather than restart, we worked from Bill's phone. It still took us quite a while to locate the cache. The marker tree had fallen, so we wandered for a bit while looking. We did finally locate it and we signed. We never even needed to shut the car off, we were so close to the parking spot. 
This was another really well done Wherigo. A really good one for somebody to learn with. Great job on the set up and neat spot for the final. Excellent cache all around. Thanks for all your effort in creating this Wherigo...it was fun. TFTH. TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

five caches in Collins Park (two are now archived). The park offers
a pavilion, baseball field, grills, many trails and a playground

This cache was named after our Geo-Dog, whose name is Acorn. Please
park at the posted parking coordinates. The cache is no longer an
acorn (used to be an plastic hanging acorn) – it is a decon
container. As with all decons please be sure to close properly or
it will not be watertight for the next finder. Don't forget a pen

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">A regular cache on some nice trails - great for the kids.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache was placed for the Re-Gift-O-Rama Event held in Collins Park in Jan 2008. Since the event some of the land has been sold off and you need to use the pkg coords given for the alternate trail head. Collins Park offers a pavilion, baseball field, grills, many trails and a playground for the kids. Bathrooms are available seasonally.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Twenty five years ago the trails in this area were more significant and were the primary routes for Shenendehowa students to get to the library, the mall and home after school. At that time, many trails criss-crossed the woods in this park and continued across Rt. 146 to additional trails that included many large sand dunes. The trails were used as a shortcut as well as a fun place to ride bikes. Sadly, today most of the trail system is gone - having been graded and replaced by commercial development.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
UPDATE 5-12-12 The cache was replaced and is now a camo'd waterproof match container, still a relatively easy find - and an easy hike for a family. Although it can be done in the winter, more than a foot will make this a tough one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Please park at the posted parking coordinates ****DO NOT park at the school when attempting this cache****.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The park and the trails are beautiful - enjoy a day at the park!&lt;br /&gt;

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">An easy and fun Earthcache located in a great kids park.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">If you live in the Tri-County area, you may be used to seeing sand
everywhere. But, did you ever stop to think of where that sand may
have come from? When we walk around in the mountains and we see
rock everywhere, it’s pretty obvious…rocks…mountains – they just
seem to go together. But..sand everywhere when we don’t see any
oceans or even large lakes next to us?? How did that happen? &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 It’s hard to believe walking around parts of Saratoga, Albany and
Schenectady Counties that only several thousand years ago this area
and much of the surrounding area was part of a great lake known as
Glacial Lake Albany. What’s even better is how the lake was formed.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As you probably know, New York and much of New England were once
covered by glaciers. The most recent of these glacial episodes
occurred approximately 12,000 – 15,000 years ago and is responsible
for much of the surficial geology we see today.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 Glaciers are masses of ice that move over land by gravity.
Glaciers that are over one-half of one mile thick, and cover large
areas of a continent are called continental glaciers or ice sheets.
Glacial Lake Albany was formed approximately 15,000 years ago when
water melting from the a portion of the Wisconsonian Ice Sheet
known as the Hudson Valley Lobe (a large finger or extension of a
continental glacier) was dammed by glacial debris located within
the area known as “the Narrows” that was just north of New York
City.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 At its largest size, Glacial Lake Albany occupied the Hudson River
Valley from the Newburgh area to Glens Falls. In the upstate area,
the shore of the lake was found at the 450 foot elevation contour.
As the glaciers retreated, sediments were carried by melt-waters
and deposited into Glacial Lake Albany.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 As the climate of the Earth warmed and the glaciers retreated
further large ice dams melted that enabled the release of water
from nearby glacial Lake Iroquois. As Lake Iroquois drained into
the glacial lakes within the Champlain and Hudson Valley areas, the
dam at the narrows collapsed and the lakes began to drain at an
overwhelming rate into the Atlantic Ocean. Many scientists believe
this catastrophic release of fresh water into the Atlantic is
responsible for an abrupt climatic change that brought about
another cooling period for the Earth that may have lasted hundreds
of years. &lt;br&gt;
This photo below from the Wood Hole Oceanographic Institute
illustrates it very well.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=
"http://www.whoi.edu/cms/images/mediarelations/2004/12/donnelly_map1_4135.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
As the lakes continued to drain, sands were deposited in large
quantities forming delta environments. Eventually, the glacial lake
was drained and the delta sands were then exposed to an air
(Aeolian) environment. Over time, the prevailing winds shaped these
exposed sands into dunes. These dunes can be found throughout the
Capital District area. A well known example of these dunes is the
Albany Pine Bush area. During the construction of the SUNY Albany
campus, the vegetation stabalizing the dunes was removed and the
dunes began to move again - causing alot of headaches for the
construction crews.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 Believe it or not, some of these dunes exist right here at Collins
Park. Your job to earn credit for this Earthcache is to find them.
Remember, the dunes were formed thousands of years ago – so, they
no longer look like dunes you are used to seeing along the shore.
The dunes are now stabile with vegetation…..no, not beach grasses.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 This is an easy Earthcache, the idea really being to give you an
understanding of how drastically our area has changed over time and
to give you a visual of how different this area looked only 12,000
years ago. If you are at the park during the summer, walk through
the trails and the sands that make up the “dunes” will be even more
apparent.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;So, to earn your smiley:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 Part 1: Walk around and locate what you think is a dune. Start
your search on the hills BEYOND the playground equipment. Now,
using your GPS, mark the elevation difference between the top and
the bottom of the dune and see how high it is.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 Part 2: Take a picture of someone in your group on top of the
dune. If you are alone, stand at the bottom and take a shot looking
up the dune.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 Part 3: Upload your photo and EMAIL your answer – DO NOT POST YOUR
ANSWER, EVEN IF ENCRYPTED OR WE WILL NEED TO DELETE YOUR
LOG!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 As always, our EC’s are meant to help you understand a little more
about the world around us and how portions of it may have been
formed. We aren’t looking to delete smiley’s for wrong answers. We
are more interested in seeing that you had fun and may have even
learned something new.&lt;br&gt;

Since others had said they had trouble with the coords on the second part I got close and then used geo sense.  When I was at GZ my GPS said I was about 62' away.  It was a quick find however.

We discovered when we still had 50 feet to go at the edge of someone's well kept yard that we had managed to enter the second stage west coordinates off by 100 on the last three digits. We  phoned a friend and discovered our error. Soon we were back off in the right direction. With Frak forging on a bit ahead, Frin picked up a stout branch to steady her sprained knee and went around the other side of the tree Frak had passed a minute or two before. Glimpsing something interesting, she investigated and sure enough there was the cache.  Then the signing ceremony commenced. Thanks for the fun.</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Previously located in Collins Park, off of Moe Road in Clifton
Park.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache was meant to be found while visiting Collins Park.
Unfortunately, since the time it was placed some of the land has
been sold off and is being developed. There are now two ways to get
to it - walk south on the bikepath (along Moe Rd) from Collins Park
and enter at the trail entrance across from the Shen Campus OR
enter at the Parking Coords trailhead by the Corporate Plaza (Rt
146)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;There is a new sign that was added to the Shen trail that states
no tresspassing during or after school hours - these are the hours
the students use the trail for track and x-country running
practice. Please adhere to the signs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cache is relatively easy as the spot was chosen by 5 children ages
3 - 11 - an easy hike for a family.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Although it can be done in the winter, snow will make it a harder
find.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cache is a 30 cam ammo can and has lots of fun things for the kids
and adults alike and the park offers a baseball field, grills and a
playground for the kids.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache was given a 2 only because trees have come down over
the trail that you need to walk around, under or in one case, climb
over (very easy) and, depending upon the weather, you could get a
little mucky. There is a small area where it may be a little muddy,
and if it has been wet - even a little swampy - you can get a
little muddy or do some bushwacking to go around it - the kids like
to do it in flip flops and take the mud route. The park and the
trails are beautiful - enjoy a day at the park!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

If you can read the L or the R, assuming you can get your head up and in there to take a peak, it's placed right.

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;As per geocaching.com "Start plotting your crafty strategy, rally your friends and prepare for a month of geocaching like no other. August is being celebrated by geocachers around the world as the “31 Days of Geocaching.” Find a geocache, log a “Found it” (or an “Attended” for an Event Cache) and earn a unique calendar-style Geocaching souvenir for each day in August. That’s 31 souvenirs up for grabs."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Mr &amp;amp; Mrs Magic for this great idea.  Congratulations to Sheffy12065 for the FTF.&lt;/p&gt;

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Please do be careful when replacing the container to make sure that the bottom of the container is against the pole. That means that the L or the R on the cover should be facing away from the pole when the container is replaced. If you can read the L or the R, assuming you can get your head up and in there to take a peak, it's placed right. Also since the log is on the narrow side, just sign your initials and don't worry about the date. Please don't force the container. If it's hard to screw shut, the container isn't set correctly on the screw threads. Please just close it gently on the threads and tighten.</groundspeak:long_description>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Once upon a time there was a geodog named Luke who barked and barked at a fence.  He barked at his owner, BurgundyBug,  to COME. OVER. HERE!   When BurgundyBug approached GZ she saw that Luke was barking at a turtle that was under the fence.  All BurgundyBug saw was the shell and wondered where the rest of the turtle was.  She picked up a stick and slowly poked at the shell, then, suddenly, the turtle snapped at the stick!  Oh, a snapping turtle!  &lt;br /&gt;
The turtle stayed there for the night and buried itself in the dirt.  &lt;br /&gt;
The next day, BurgundyBug used a shovel and put the turtle in a pail.  She brought it to its current location (as per a discussion with a local animal control officer) so it could be close to water and sun itself with the other turtles that have been seen here.&lt;br /&gt;
When you find the cache be sure to look for Snappy and say hi!&lt;br /&gt;
Be sure to look at the pictures below so you know what Snappy looks like.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Headed to Clifton Park to do some shopping and decided to grab a couple of caches on the way for the 26th day of 31 days of caching during the month of August.  A quick find @ 1640 hrs today after the short walk from Carlson Way.  Never knew this family plot was back here … nicely taken care of area.  Now I know where the road’s name came from.  As I’ve said before, you learn something new every day, especially geocaching.  Replaced cache as found.  No one around at the time of the find, signing and replace.  SL  TFTC
Now regarding the number of Moes … from my gravestone iconography research for a course in college many years ago, early colonial burial grounds usually had a head and foot stone.  This foot stone sometimes had the deceased’s initials, but a lot of times they were un-carved especially in small family cemeteries.  I assume when the Town cleaned up the area and placed the historic marker and plaques, they did the research and would have documented the small stone …??  The small blank stone may have been moved over the years and put in the wrong place during the restoration project.  If this stone is actually a foot stone, it probably was for Mary’s grave [1799].  Just my thoughts on the subject.  Therefore … I would make it 2 Moe, Abraham and Mary.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Longest Streak - 99 consecutive days with finds from 03/12/2013 to 06/18/2013!  
Woohoo!  Yay!  Yippee!!!  I cannot believe I did this!  One day I decided I would see how far I could get trying to find a cache a day. I never thought I would go to 99 days, with today being day 100 getting this cache.  Solving the puzzle was quick and getting the cache was quicker.  I was out early this morning with no one in sight (people that is, there were two crows on top of the cache site).  The container had water in it so I did my best to dry it out.  The log was dry due to being in the baggy.  Great way to start the day! Gets a favorite. TFTC and the challenge!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This grab puts my current streak at 203 days. I never thought I would ever make it this long, but so far the stars have aligned for me. 

Apparently I am slow as I needed a hint from the CO to understand what the puzzle was. Once I got the clue the find was easy. 

Not sure how long this streak will go. I know I will not make the 1 year mark as I will be "off the grid" and away from any caches for a few days at the end of the summer. Until then....

When the qualifications changed though, well heck we have numerous days of over 99 caches! Our best day, 277 caches on 05/13/2012. The next issue we had was that we don't get down this way very often! La's employer opened an office near to the final....and she had to go down there on business last week...and of course it was raining! Dressed for work, she just couldn't grab it!
She had to run back down to that office today, and everything worked out for her to be able to finally sign the log!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We had solved this mystery about a week ago and were saving it for a day in August.  It's almost literally in the backyard for us as the trail goes right next to our yard.  The mosquitos were out in force and started swarming around us almost as soon as we started down the trail.  As two young boys approached us, the one carrying a can of bug spray informed us that the bugs were awful back there. [:(] [}:)] The can should ahve been a clue that we were heading into Mosquitoland. [:)!] After all the area had been underwater all spring! The mosquito "presence" was especially bad news to Frak who seems to think that the nasty critters are specifically out to get him. [:D][V] [:o)] 

As we reached GZ, the GPSr pointed us about 38 feet into the woods. [V] We foolishly followed the arrow and found nothing but swarms of hungry skeeters. Frak was ready to pack it in to find another cache but Frin saw an interesting tree that turned out to be a red herring. She continued on back towards the trail and then saw something else suspiciously familiar.[8D][;)][:0}[:X]. Sure enough after a little reaching and poking she found the cache.[8D]

This was an interesting mystery to solve that took a readjustment in thinking. Thanks for the fun and for filling in Day 5 of August.</groundspeak:text>

The cache is just hidden really well, between the puzzle and the hide that's why it has the difficulty rating it does. Cache is close to the established trail. Coords might be a bit off, I'm checking on that. If anyone that has solved the puzzle would like a hint about where the cache is, feel free to contact me!! I will help you get that smiley.

&lt;h1&gt;The Parkers' TB B&amp;amp;B&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our first venture into the TB B&amp;amp;B we are starting small.
Accomodations are available a few guests in our deluxe, dorm-style,
1-room B&amp;amp;B. Extra security has been implemented to help protect
the coins and bugs that end up staying here. An expansion may occur
if occupancy dictates. Easy access to our B&amp;amp;B can be made via a
North or South direction. Special note for south-bound driver: make
sure to exit the second ramp. Initial occupancy included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#17 Racer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In search of Veterans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleepy troll TB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Throwin’ Da Bomb!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NNY Geocoin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This B&amp;amp;B has very simple rules: 
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check-in: Check your contents and B&amp;amp;B availability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you take a TB, then leave a TB.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is ok to leave TB's without taking TB's&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please be considerate and don't "clean out" the B&amp;amp;B of
travelers...this is just rude and unfair to other visitors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Normal ‘swag’ may be traded, but not at the expense of taking
away a TB’s room.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be attentive of TB’s desires. Please read the goals of TB’s
before taking as their goals and your may not match.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checkout: Sign Logbook&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">After Richard E's log entry yesterday, I went and checked on this cache.  Although it has been made slightly more difficult by subsequent cachers, it is still in place and ready to go.  Definitely "getable" with proper inspection of the area. Also coordinates checked out within +/- 10 feet... But this is a high overhead foliage area so perfection is difficult with these type of hides.  Curiously, didn't see Richard E's physical sign in log... but we'll forgive him this time!</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is a cache in the Kinns Road Bike/Hiking Park.  It was placed there on Independence Day , 2002.  The entrance to the park is, obviously, on Kinns Road.  There are many trails to choose from.  The cache is in a small ammo box.  Good luck.

****Since jeeperscreepers(a.k.a. poto228) was called into servire, I went out and replaced the cache ...it  is filled with army men, planes and american flags.

Being that the original owner has been called into service, I thought it would be nice to use this cache to honor our serivce men and women.   I have left a plastic zipper envelope in the cache ..please fill it with drawings and letters for our troops.  I'll send the letters out after every 5 or 10 letters.  I'll also keep a copy of each letter to give to jeeperscreepers when he comes home.  Please help to give those serving our country a little piece of home :)   

Hopefully our troops will come home quickly and safely!

Since she lives in Saratoga County and works in Albany she’s been spending more and more on gas just to get to work.  Now she had decided to give the commuter buses a try so that she can save more of her gas money for caching trips.</groundspeak:short_description>

Using some geo-sense, walked right up to GZ and made the grab.  Number 3 of 3 today.  No one in the area at the time of the find, signing and replace.  TNLN  SL  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="False">A nice, short 3-part trip mostly along a gravel trail.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">We’d been eyeing this spot while the park was being built, and had hoped to be the first ones to place a cache in this park, but we weren’t fast enough!  Well, there’s room to share (barely!)...

This new nature park has a nice network of trails and bridges.  Lots of wildlife here too – we’ve seen foxes, turkeys, deer, muskrat, coyotes, and a wealth of birds, rodents, and amphibians.  The area used to be a melon farm in the mid-twentieth century . Wow, how things have changed.  For more about the history, see: 
http://www.cnweekly.com/articles/2011/04/29/news/doc4db9c89c570e3488614345.txt

The GPS was a bit jumpy, but the coordinates should be pretty close.  The first two are micros, the last container is non-traditional, contains just a log book and writing implements.  All pieces of this three-parter are very close to the trails, so please watch out for muggles – there are a lot around.  Watch out for ticks and skeeters too, when it’s the season.

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">A kid friendly cache (KFC) plastic container hidden at the Hayes Nature Park in Clifton Park. Please BYOP for now - I just noticed the pencils for the cache here at my computer.. Oops!</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Last summer, I attended the first mega event of New England - the Berkshire GeoBash in Pittsfield, MA. One of the things they had happening at the event was a Chinese Auction for all kinds of nice prizes. I bought a sheets worth of tickets and went around hoping I'd be lucky and have my number picked for something.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When they listed all the winners, I was completely shocked. I had won something, and it was something that had loads of other tickets in it - a stocked cache container. That's the container you'll see here when you find this cache!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please, please, please rehide this cache carefully and make sure you can not see it from the trails. Our last cache in the area was muggled, I hope that this one will stick around a bit longer! :)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Parking for the preserve is located off of Moe Rd, just north of Thoroughbred Way. Posted hours for the preserve are 5:30 am - 10:00 pm. Please respect the hours the town has posted and only search for the cache between these times.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is hidden very close to the parking area. This is a lovely preserve. Bring plenty of bug spray in the warmer months. Also, be sure to check out other caches in here - a multicache as well as another one of my hides - First to Find? Have fun!&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Found @ 1625 hrs today after a short search.  GPSr had GZ in the wooded area on the wrong side of the trail.  After looking around a few minutes and not seeing any place to “hide” a regular sized cache, switched to geo-sense instead of looking at the GPSr and made the find.  Nice area … Great hide.  Replaced cache as found.  No one around at the time of the find, signing and replace.  TNLN  SL  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

This cache is something between a small and a micro.  Since it can contain very small items, I have chosen small.  It is a non-traditional container; I have never seen a container like this before.

I have tried this non-traditional container on 2 other hides today but I am not sure if it will be recognizable for what it really is due to camo tape...

The container "unscrews" in two ways and either one will work, however, please do NOT remove the top from where it is attached.  The container can be slightly difficult to "re-screw" together correctly so please make sure there is no gaps where water could seep in when you are done!

   <groundspeak:short_description html="False">The Historic Grooms Tavern is located at the corner of Grooms Road and Sugar Hill road.  This building was where the first town meeting for Clifton Park took place.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Historic Grooms Tavern

The Historic Grooms Tavern began as a store in the early 1800s.  In April 1828 the tavern was owned by James Grooms and was the location of the first town meeting for Clifton Park. James Grooms was a town clerk from 1832 to 1835, a town supervisor in 1836 and 1837 and an assembly man around 1840
James’ son Samuel was the next owner of the Inn.  About 1847 he remodeled it and added a second story to the building. Town meetings were held intermittingly from 1848 to 1868. Samuel also used part of the building as a wagon shop.  There are inscriptions that are penciled and stenciled with names of patrons.
By the late 1800s, the Historic Grooms Tavern was reestablished as a store and was also known as a post office.
Prior to 1900 another major remodeling was completed and a wraparound porch was added.
After the passing of James Grooms in 1922, his widow, Julia, sold the store to Edward and Mabel Klingbeil Jr. They installed gas pumps, set up a pool room inside, and rented 3 bedrooms upstairs. 
After the passing of Edward in December of 1970, his widow Chris (his 5th wife) sold the store in May 1971 to Kenneth and Mary Jane Baird.  Kenneth Baird died in 1988 and his widow sold the store to Robert Williams and his wife Kathy Hedrick.  
Robert, an architect, and Kathy a realtor, wanted to construct a restaurant.  Zoning and finance problems hindered their efforts.  In December 1999 the Town of Clifton Park acquired the Grooms Tavern.  
The Town of Clifton Park has since restored the downstairs and reopened the tavern in April 2007.

After you find the ammo can be sure to check out the tavern.

I saw the last find was a few months ago and was worried it may not be there.  Reached GZ in no time but finding the cache was not that simple.  Took the kids and I about 15 minutes to find it.  Replaced as we found it and learned a bit about the history behind the Tavern.  The kids enjoyed the seach, location and cache so much we're going to award this one our first favorite point.

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This evening while watching the news, I saw that Clifton Park had the grand opening of a new park preserve. beeb294 and I decided to go for an evening stroll around the preserve and try to place a cache.

Hide a cache we did, and we are thinking are we the First to Hide? here in the new preserve. 

Enjoy a nice peaceful stroll through the area. The trails are gravel and nicely defined with pretty level terrain. There is no reason to stray from the trails until you are basically at GZ. 

Parking for the preserve is located off of Moe Rd, just north of Thoroughbred Way. Posted hours for the preserve are 5:30 am - 10:00 pm. Please respect the hours the town has posted and only search for the cache between these times.

&lt;p&gt;Probing Digit has been remanufactued! I have made substantial improvements to the overall design and user friendliness of this cache so, hopefully, it'll have some longevity.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The hide is virtually the same so those of you who have found it previously should have no trouble here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The method of attachment is different and so too is the method of log extraction. &lt;b&gt;Please replace it carefully for the next cacher&lt;/b&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another sadistic cache from the twisted mind of the Neumanns! Someone has to feed your need, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This location has plenty of parking and the walkin' is easy. Just be prepared for a tricky hide and mega muggles. I placed this at 4pm on a weekday and if I got away with that you'll get away with looking, so no worries!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My only request here is that you use caution with the container and replace EXACTLY as you found it. If for some reason you cannot, let me know right away.&lt;/p&gt;
Cache on!&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">A kid friendly cache (KFC) - a small lock and lock container in the Dwaaskill Nature Preserve in Clifton Park. Please bring your own pen!</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Named for the stream running through it, The Dwaaskill Nature Preserve is a lovely natural area in Clifton Park. There are a few caches over on the eastern part of the trails, but this cache will bring you to the western side of the preserve. This side of the preserve is still under much development. Town maps show that this side has plans for more future trails and even another parking area.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Enjoy this quiet area of the preserve and check out all the work that the beavers have been up to back in here! I wonder how long it has taken them to do all the work they have already done. Maybe you be lucky and see a beaver hard at work while you are out caching.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is room for one car to park on the side of the road - please make sure you pull off Kinns Rd completely. Otherwise, park on nearby Nadler Rd and walk over.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please note - the preserve has strict hours of 5 am - 10 pm, please do not hunt this cache outside of these hours. Due to the stream nearby, I also would not recommend doing this one in the dark. Better safe than sorry!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
*****Congrats to TJ and MarD for FTF!*****&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Welcome to the Woodcock Preserve!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This multi-cache is the first of the caches designed to
introduce people to the Woodcock Preserve. This parcel of land
owned and managed by the Saratoga P.L.A.N. was named after the
American Woodcock, a shorebird that lives in forests. It can most
frequently be encountered at dusk when they are most active. During
the day they are hard to spot due to their very good camouflage
that helps them to easily blend in to their surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This preserve consists of a mix of 64 acres of wetlands and
forest. My mother and I got involved in maintaining this preserve
back in the Fall of '09. I had previously had my eye on it
for quite some time as I had noticed the signs near the parking
area upwards to two years ago. Each time I was in the area I would
drive by to see if I could see any activity or signs of more than
just a parking lot. This finally happened in the Fall where, after
finishing work, I stopped, noticed some trail markers (which I had
previously missed) and decided to follow them. As "The
Spleen" says in "Mystery Men" to Invisible Boy,
"BIG MISTAKE!" The trail, at that time, took one
through the wooded area, past an overgrown field, and through a
swamp. Who would put trail markers there? We later found out that
beavers had been active and raised the water level therefore
flooding the original trail. Long story short: My Mother and I are
now the stewards for this preserve and with the help of Highland
Ranger and my Father, we have:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cleared the field&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trimmed back/widened the trails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-routed the trail in a couple of really wet areas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Placed stepping stones for some water crossings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installed some turnpiking, corduroy, bog bridging, and other
rudimentary trail improvements with only the use hand tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a new trail and are working on another one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a wetlands area and even during some really dry times
one can still find some wonderfully sticky mud! Watch your footing
and plan your path as best as you can! This is still a work in
progress improvement and we have more wet areas than easily
available materials to deal with them so please be patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the first in a small series of "Cool Facts"
about the American Woodcock:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The flexible tip of the American Woodcock's bill is specialized
for catching earthworms. The bird probably feels worms as it probes
in the ground. A woodcock may rock its body back and forth without
moving its head as it slowly walks around, stepping heavily with
its front foot. This action may make worms move around in the soil,
increasing their detectablity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The American Woodcock is one of the few shorebirds that is
regularly hunted for sport.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information provided with help from:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: You, and all members of your party must read and
agree to the www.geocaching.com disclaimer. In addition, you all
must agree to hold the cache owner, www.geocaching.com, and the
landowners harmless from any and all causes for action. You and all
other members of your party must individually and collectively
determine your/their physical fitness and outdoors/hiking skill
levels, decide whether or not to visit the various cache locations,
and whether or not it is safe and prudent to do so under the
conditions that will be encountered. Cache seekers assume all risks
involved in seeking these cache locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People that do not wish to do a cache because of any danger they
might perceive to be present is certainly within their right to not
proceed. However you do not have the right to try to ruin the
enjoyment of others in attempting a find that is beyond your
capabilities, but not beyond theirs. This goes for almost every
caching event there is. After all one might run into spiders,
snakes, poisonous plants, broken glass, trips and falls and the
list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safety First! .......Take a friend, Look out for others, take a
cell phone if possible, watch where you're stepping, NEVER UNCOVER
ANY CACHE WITH YOUR HANDS OR FEET, USE A STICK! If you feel
uncomfortable in doing a cache, for any reason, just walk
away!!!&lt;/p&gt;

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Kid Friendly Cache Series - Great Swamp</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">When we first started caching in 2002 the caches were all regular
sized ammo cans, tupperware or similar sized containers. the kids
enjoyed taking fun walks in the woods and we enjoyed the
opportunity to get them outside having some fun. Although we love
the walks, to the kids the best part is finding the cache and
digging through to see what goodies are in the latest find.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Today there is a huge variety of caches and hiding styles - which
is great and makes the game even more fun. But this series is
designed for parents who want to take the kids out on a trail and
enjoy some family time with a prize at the end. Any time you see
one of our caches that starts with "KFC" - it will be a nice walk
on an easy trail with an easy to find cache at the end that the
kids can enjoy. Feel free to name your own "Kid Friendly Caches"
with a KFC in the name as well so others know yours is a cache the
kids will enjoy too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;KFC - Great Swamp&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
KFC - Great Swamp takes you to the Woodcock Preserve.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From the Saratoga PLAN website:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The site is an active Woodcock management area with early
successional species and is a proposed environment
education/recreation site. Woodland and forested wetland habitat
with abundant wildlife (Deer, Coyote, Red-tailed Hawk, Barred Owl,
Pileated Woodpecker) and several very old Swamp White Oak
trees.Saratoga PLAN stewards are currently re-routing trails around
the beaver flooded areas in the western portion of this Preserve. A
short hike is possible to the open field area from the parking lot.
Parking for 2 cars. Adjacent to the parking lot lies a strip about
235 feet wide, running east to west about 1500 feet until it meets
an open field. The western portion of the parcel consists of
state-identified wetlands and is wet through most of the year. The
topography is flat, and the ecology consists of woodlands over 35
years old. Flora includes partridgeberry, trout lily, aspen, black
oak, and birch. Fauna includes squirrels, turkey, nuthatches, and
fox.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The preserve has a lot of great trails including planks to walk on,
log bridges and rocks to jump from one to the other while crossing
small streams or low areas. There is also wildlife everywhere and a
lot to see as you make your way through. There are wetlands
throughout the preserve, so bring old shoes and don't be afraid to
get a little muddy. This cache gives you a nice view of a "great
swamp".&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most of all - have fun!</groundspeak:long_description>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p align="justify"&gt;Oh no! Here comes one of those cdparker1
   multi-caches!! Should I put it on my ignore list or should I
   attempt to find it? Well, only you can decide what you want to
   do. I put no caches on my ignore list. They’ll stare me in my
   face until I do them or until they are archived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Pitch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;I am not going to lead you through this multi
from spot to spot. Nope! I’m going to be really nice and give you
ALL OF THE WAYPOINTS that are considered the parts of this
multi-cache. I will tell you, no, better yet, show you what you are
looking for, in a waypoint along the way. What I will not give you
is the final location. That you get to find by yourself or in a
group. Better hurry , though, as there are talks of this area being
developed into more homes for those snobby Clifton Park
people….hey, wait a minute! I’m from Clifton Park!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;When my parents first moved to Clifton Park oh
so many years ago, they decided to buy a new house in this
neighborhood for the whopping price of about $25,000. Currently
there are two that I know of that are listed from
$199,000-$219,000. Quite a difference a few decades makes! Anyways,
Manchester Drive is where we grew up in the Northwood development.
As kids, we would walk through the woods, up to what we knew as
First Field. There were legends of 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th
fields…many more than we ever really knew. Years later, I would end
up riding my dirt bike through here and my sister would ride her
horse. The trails would take you from Exit 8A down to Exit 8 or
vice versa. They would also spur off towards Dunsbach Road, one
leading to where my sister boarded her horse, and another that came
out by the trailer park. Both of those points you may come to, but
do not to try and find either of them as starting points as they do
not have access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Access&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;The access became more limited when they decided
to build a couple of homes where we accessed the woods. Their
driveways took up the trail-head and other points were generally
more private, leading out of one’s backyard. Within the past decade
a couple of roads were built/extended which made for new access
points. The one that you will be using is off of Princeton Avenue
(limited to off street parking). If a group of people are
attempting to do this cache, then it may be advisable to car pool
to the parking area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Maps?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;I have broken my map down to six fields and a
hill area. I will be working on making some sort of map available.
Please make sure to mark your starting point. It is pretty easy to
NOT get lost due to the proximity to the Northway, but there are a
myriad of trails throughout this area and not a one of them are
marked. The only bush-whacking you will need to do is about a few
feet off of the trails to find the micros and a bit more to get to
the final location of the cache. The trails will get you where you
need to go, so please stay on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How long is this hike anyways?!?!?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;Well, I guess it comes down to dumb luck. On my
first trek through the area of trails that I remembered, I closed
out my day with an odometer of 3.5 miles. Upon review, I noticed
that I had not even gotten to a spot where I rode my dirt bike. The
next trip, which was used for marking waypoints, yielded a trek of
6.5 miles. Depending on the path that you choose and where you come
into the “waypoint trail” your distance may vary. Rusty O Junk
helped me with a ‘trial-run’ and by the end of that, we had logged
around 7 miles. Going in circles, of course, will add some time and
distance to your day! Give yourself some time, bring some snacks ‘n
things, make an afternoon of it and enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Safety First&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are a few points which exit to private property. Some of
those points you will see are used by those with either dirt bikes
or 4-wheelers. Keeping this in mind, please be careful when hiking
through the woods as they may also be out there driving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have pulled off a quite a few ticks from my treks through
here so a tick-check would be advisable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watch out for rusty items. I saw a van and two cars junked here
as well as sofas, couches, and other assorted garbage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was also told to watch out for hunters. I have never seen any
back here, but that does not mean they are not out there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Consideration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;Speaking of that private property, please be
considerate of the people that live by some of the dead ends that
you will come across during your hike through the woods. Yes, some
of those same people were not considerate when they used the woods
as their own personal dump-site, but we don’t want to lower
ourselves to their level by adding to the trash. There is one spot
in particular that looks like a mini dump-pit…believe me, you will
know what I mean if you happen to choose that path!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Do not pass go!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;This area is bordered by many homes and
businesses. Many people will most likely think you are just walking
the paths. Many will ignore you. Others, as you know, may be more
inquisitive of you or possessive of the area. Best bet is to cache
in stealth. Stay away from the waypoints that I have indicated are
boundary waypoints as those would be the ones that would give you
trouble. Stay away from the driving range. THEY WILL COME OUT IF
THEY SEE YOU! We made the mistake of crossing the back edge of the
driving range and an employee asked us what we were doing. Luckily
I saw him quick enough and put away my hammer that I was using to
place tags. Suffice it to say, a few waypoints were deleted from
the list so as to keep you further away from here. Don’t tempt
fate. STAY AWAY!!! Look at the boundary map below to see where NOT
to go!&lt;/p&gt;

     &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 
&lt;h3&gt;Back to what you are doing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;Park your car and pick a waypoint that you want
to visit. Find the micro to determine if you have chosen wisely or
if grasshopper has to go back to another waypoint. If you choose
incorrectly, you will find a penny with “DNF” stamped on it. If you
choose correctly, you will find a small square/rectangle of
aluminum with coordinates stamped on it. There will be multiple
correct choices to make during this cache, so you may come into the
middle of the “trail” or right at the beginning. As you find
incorrect waypoints, delete them from your GPS or mark them in some
manner so that you know that you have been there. When you get to
the final micro, it will have stamped upon it “FINAL” so that you
know that your quest will be over once you find that “Final”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Remind you of…?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;Ever read one of those books that lets you
choose where the story goes by going to one page or another page?
That is the inspiration to this one. So, I guess I lied earlier
when I said that I would let you choose the path and that I would
not be leading you hand in hand to the subsequent spot. But you do
get to choose where you start and, by that, you choose your
destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The micros…&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;Most tags are within a few feet of the trail,
placed so that the non-cacher should not see them. It’s all about
the angle. The reception in here varies due to tree cover. If you
are having problems finding a tag, try spreading out a bit. They
are all nailed to trees from waist-height to about head-height and
look like….&lt;/p&gt;

border="0" alt="Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 
&lt;h3&gt;Bring this too!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Print out and bring the waypoint portion of this cache with you.
Trust me, it will make things much easier!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Found it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;When you arrive for the final, you will be
searching for a cache container that is cylindrical in shape. If
you are doing this cache during the winter months, it is reasonable
that it could get frozen in place. If this is the case, then you
can unscrew the top of the container to access its contents. Please
re-hide better than you found it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;First To Find item…&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FTF for this cache will find an unactivated geocoin in the
cache container&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bonus?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the astute: find the clues to be able to search for another
cache. This is the only way to log that cache.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">When I started Geocaching again in December of 2010, I have been wanting to grab this cache. It always showed up on my list for caches that I have yet to find. Over the summer I was going to tackle this cache alone but when I pulled up the info on my phone I was extremely intimidated by the size and left without even attempting. I can finally say that this is checked off my list. [:)] 

It was a cold and chilly morning when nwk_berlin, The Nuemanns, RenMin, loves to fish, and I started on our adventure. We decided to go after a couple waypoints as a group to find out what exactly we were looking for and how the pennies and plate were placed. After a couple no shows I finally found a penny. After that we split up and searched for clues to the final. I hit four or five of waypoints by myself coming up empty handed on some and finding some pennies and plates. While looking for the fifth or sixth waypoint, I was about to give up. I thought that I was looking for a penny that was long gone. As I was about to head to the next waypoint something caught my eye. The sun had reflected off something and made its way in my direction. I walked up to the plate and was surprised to see that it had the final coordinates printed on it. If it hadn't caught my eye we might had been searching for much longer than we did. I was so exited that I quickly called the two other groups and told them what I had found and the coordinates to the final. We met up at the car and drove to another parking area so that we would not have to walk far to the cache. As a group we trekked to GZ. It only took a couple of minutes to come up with the cache. But I am glad to say that I found its hiding spot. We signed the log and the Nuemanns called the CO to brag and compliment on such a challenging cache. TFTC. 

After we made it back to the car we decided what we were going to do next. We decided to bring a little more Misery into our live. After all Misery Love Company.

I love going out in groups to find caches. It makes the experience that much more richer. And todays company was absolutely outstanding. We made a really good team.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">When RenMin first asked me to join him for this cache a few weeks back I decided to give it a look first.  I couldn't find it on the map!  Ultimately, it took a bit but I finally found it....on my ignore list.  I guess in my early days caching I thought this would be too much for me!  Looking at it with more experienced eyes I was excited to take on the challenge!  

Looking at the task ahead I thought it wise to assemble a group and tackle this with the team approach.  This tactic turned out to be what led us to a relatively fast find today.  As three teams we took a methodical approach to the task.  RenMin and I thought we were on the right track early but soon realized it was just the beginning.  A lucky find by The Deathly Hallows soon had us headed to the final as a group.  It was truly a sense of accomplishment with cache in hand!

As a "cache engineer" myself I was in awe(as I usually am when seeking out cdparker1 caches)at the thought and the labor that went into placing this behemoth!  Although there we some components missing, everything important is in place and the hunt is as fun as ever.  We don't cache much anymore becuase life gets so busy...but this was so worth our time and I'm not sure we could have chosen a better way to spend a Saturday.  Thanks for one of the finest caches we've done.  Oh, fine...I SUPPOSE I'll give it a favorite point!

&lt;br /&gt;
Dylan thought of this one and it involves his favorite place.&lt;br /&gt;
It is a multi-part puzzle cache with a twist.&lt;br /&gt;
Please try it the way Dylan envisioned it,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;If you have any issues, PLEASE ask!!&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;So, inquiring eight year old minds want to
know...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dylan:&lt;/b&gt; Hey, Dad?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dad:&lt;/b&gt; Yeah, Dyl?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dylan:&lt;/b&gt; How did people geo-cache before
GPSs were invented?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dad:&lt;/b&gt; Well, they didn't because they
couldn't.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dylan:&lt;/b&gt; Why not?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dad:&lt;/b&gt; You need a GPS to get the
co-ordinates of where the thing is hidden.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dylan:&lt;/b&gt; Couldn't you just give them hints
instead?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dad:&lt;/b&gt; What do you mean?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dylan:&lt;/b&gt; Instead of giving the co-ordinates
of where it was hidden, can't you just say go to 'this place' and
look for 'this thing'?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dad:&lt;/b&gt; Ummmmmm....&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dylan:&lt;/b&gt; This way, you wouldn't need a GPS
and you could see if people could figure out the clues. I mean, the
GPS tells them exactly where to go, right?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dad:&lt;/b&gt; Yes. But sometimes, even knowing
exactly where to go doesn't make it easy. Remember your FTF?
&lt;a href="http://coord.info/GC375PN/"&gt;(Dylan's FTF!)&lt;/a&gt; We knew
exactly where to go, and even with Frin and Frak and Mom
Geolslider, it still took us over half an hour to find
it.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dylan:&lt;/b&gt; Yeah, so the clue for that one
would have said "Go to the sign for the old Drive-In movie in
Stillwater." We would have been in the right spot
anyway.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dad:&lt;/b&gt; What if it was hidden in the
woods?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dylan:&lt;/b&gt; So?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dad:&lt;/b&gt; What are you going to tell them, "Go
to the third tree on the left?"&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dylan:&lt;/b&gt; If that where I was going to hide
it, yes.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dad:&lt;/b&gt; What if it was was a multi-part in
the woods? How do you get them to the next tree?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dylan:&lt;/b&gt; Simple. Go 42 steps West to the
next tree."&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dad:&lt;/b&gt; Ahhh..But how big are the steps?
Your steps? or my steps?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;The conversation continued and the more I thought about it,
he did have a point.&lt;br /&gt;
He said he wanted to make one that just had clues instead of
co-ords.&lt;br /&gt;
We thought about it and talked about it and he made some
sense.&lt;br /&gt;
He picked the locations and came up with the clues and here they
are.&lt;br /&gt;
Well, he has provided you with the initial starting point
co-ordinates - which he was not happy about!&lt;br /&gt;
Go there for your first clue.&lt;br /&gt;
Please let him know what you think and how good his clues
are!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Final is a small cammoed contained, big enough for a log, pencils
and a few trackables. We even put a Bug that we found the other day
in there to start it off!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oh yeah, and to make it interesting...FTF gets an unactivated
Travel Bug Dog Tag!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And remember...no peaking at the hint!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Good Luck!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
    <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Dylan wants to know if you tried it without looking here?? Be honest!! You can't lie to an eight year old with puppy-dog eyes, can you?

Stage 2: Try going to the other end of the road
Stage 3: Look in the farthest corner of the parking lot
Final: Not too far from where you are standing....

Dylan will be very upset with you!!</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

First clue was easy. Second left us with choices but we picked the right one. Last was again clear as a bell.

What I think you were describing was letter boxing. If nobody previously has suggested that, take a look. As I understand them, they work like this.

Thanks for the fun.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;h1&gt;Welcome to the Woodcock Preserve!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This multi-cache is the first of the caches designed to
introduce people to the Woodcock Preserve. This parcel of land
owned and managed by the Saratoga P.L.A.N. was named after the
American Woodcock, a shorebird that lives in forests. It can most
frequently be encountered at dusk when they are most active. During
the day they are hard to spot due to their very good camouflage
that helps them to easily blend in to their surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This preserve consists of a mix of 64 acres of wetlands and
forest. My mother and I got involved in maintaining this preserve
back in the Fall of '09. I had previously had my eye on it
for quite some time as I had noticed the signs near the parking
area upwards to two years ago. Each time I was in the area I would
drive by to see if I could see any activity or signs of more than
just a parking lot. This finally happened in the Fall where, after
finishing work, I stopped, noticed some trail markers (which I had
previously missed) and decided to follow them. As "The
Spleen" says in "Mystery Men" to Invisible Boy,
"BIG MISTAKE!" The trail, at that time, took one
through the wooded area, past an overgrown field, and through a
swamp. Who would put trail markers there? We later found out that
beavers had been active and raised the water level therefore
flooding the original trail. Long story short: My Mother and I are
now the stewards for this preserve and with the help of Highland
Ranger and my Father, we have:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cleared the field&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trimmed back/widened the trails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-routed the trail in a couple of really wet areas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Placed stepping stones for some water crossings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installed some turnpiking, corduroy, bog bridging, and other
rudimentary trail improvements with only the use hand tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a new trail and are working on another one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a wetlands area and even during some really dry times
one can still find some wonderfully sticky mud! Watch your footing
and plan your path as best as you can! This is still a work in
progress improvement and we have more wet areas than easily
available materials to deal with them so please be patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache was placed near where we were visited by a Yellow
Bellied Sapsucker whilst working and eating in the preserve. It
also happens to be what I have deemed the yellow trail. This trail
is marked wit yellow surveyor's tape for now and we hope to
have coinciding yellow markers once funding is made available for
them. This is also an area we are still working on to help people
traverse some very wet areas. We call it a demonstration area for
bridging those wet areas. How many types of bridging can you
find?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the next in a small series of "Cool Facts"
about the American Woodcock:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The male American Woodcock gives no parental care, but
continues to display long after most females have laid eggs. Some
males display at several, widely separated singing grounds and will
mate with several females. A female may visit four or more singing
grounds before nesting, and she may keep visiting even when she is
caring for her young..&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlike many birds that leave their nests at hatching, newly
hatched woodcocks cannot feed themselves. They are dependent on the
mother for food for the first week. The chicks start to probe in
dirt at three or four days after hatching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: You, and all members of your party must read and
agree to the www.geocaching.com disclaimer. In addition, you all
must agree to hold the cache owner, www.geocaching.com, and the
landowners harmless from any and all causes for action. You and all
other members of your party must individually and collectively
determine your/their physical fitness and outdoors/hiking skill
levels, decide whether or not to visit the various cache locations,
and whether or not it is safe and prudent to do so under the
conditions that will be encountered. Cache seekers assume all risks
involved in seeking these cache locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People that do not wish to do a cache because of any danger they
might perceive to be present is certainly within their right to not
proceed. However you do not have the right to try to ruin the
enjoyment of others in attempting a find that is beyond your
capabilities, but not beyond theirs. This goes for almost every
caching event there is. After all one might run into spiders,
snakes, poisonous plants, broken glass, trips and falls and the
list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safety First! .......Take a friend, Look out for others, take a
cell phone if possible, watch where you're stepping, NEVER UNCOVER
ANY CACHE WITH YOUR HANDS OR FEET, USE A STICK! If you feel
uncomfortable in doing a cache, for any reason, just walk
away!!!&lt;/p&gt;

trail to keep people out of the mud and wetlands!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the next in a small series of "Cool Facts"
about the American Woodcock:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The male American Woodcock has an elaborate display to attract
females. He gives repeated "peents" on the ground, often on
remaining patches of snow in the early spring. After a time he
flies upward in a wide spiral. As he gets higher, his wings start
to twitter. After reaching a height of 70-100 m (230-328 ft) the
twittering becomes intermittent, and the bird starts chirping as he
starts to descend. He comes down in a zig-zag, diving fashion,
chirping as he goes. As he comes near the ground he silently lands,
near a female if she is present. Then he starts peenting
again..&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People that do not wish to do a cache because of any danger they

cell phone if possible, watch where you're stepping, NEVER UNCOVER
ANY CACHE WITH YOUR HANDS OR FEET, USE A STICK! If you feel

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">KFC - On the Edge</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">When we first started caching in 2002 the caches were all regular
sized ammo cans, tupperware or similar sized containers. the kids
enjoyed taking fun walks in the woods and we enjoyed the
opportunity to get them outside having some fun. Although we love
the walks, to the kids the best part is finding the cache and
digging through to see what goodies are in the latest find.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Today there is a huge variety of caches and hiding styles - which
is great and makes the game even more fun. But this series is
designed for parents who want to take the kids out on a trail and
enjoy some family time with a prize at the end. Any time you see
one of our caches that starts with "KFC" - it will be a nice walk
on an easy trail with an easy to find cache at the end that the
kids can enjoy. Feel free to name your own "Kid Friendly Caches"
with a KFC in the name as well so others know yours is a cache the
kids will enjoy too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;KFC - On the Edge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
KFC - On the Edge takes you to the Woodcock Preserve.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From the Saratoga PLAN website:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The site is an active Woodcock management area with early
successional species and is a proposed environment
education/recreation site. Woodland and forested wetland habitat
with abundant wildlife (Deer, Coyote, Red-tailed Hawk, Barred Owl,
Pileated Woodpecker) and several very old Swamp White Oak
trees.Saratoga PLAN stewards are currently re-routing trails around
the beaver flooded areas in the western portion of this Preserve. A
short hike is possible to the open field area from the parking lot.
Parking for 2 cars. Adjacent to the parking lot lies a strip about
235 feet wide, running east to west about 1500 feet until it meets
an open field. The western portion of the parcel consists of
state-identified wetlands and is wet through most of the year. The
topography is flat, and the ecology consists of woodlands over 35
years old. Flora includes partridgeberry, trout lily, aspen, black
oak, and birch. Fauna includes squirrels, turkey, nuthatches, and
fox.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The preserve has a lot of great trails including planks to walk on,
log bridges and rocks to jump from one to the other while crossing
small streams or low areas. There is also wildlife everywhere and a
lot to see as you make your way through. There are wetlands
throughout the preserve, so bring old shoes and don't be afraid to
get a little muddy.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is hidden along an edge of the preserve just before the
area gets a little swampy. Its not far from the trail and is an
easy large ammo can to find.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most of all - have fun!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt; Be warned... these trails are not very well kept and nature is slowly but surely taking them over. We could use some geocachers to keep the foliage at bay.  Also some thorny bushes here and there along the path.  It is possible to keep left on the trail and avoid going through a small stream. Definitely don't have to cross the Dwaskill - so you went the wrong way if you are up against that challenge!  But that is part of the adventure of a find like this one... isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Park at the northwest corner of Kinns and Pierce roads, SOUTH OF THE BRIDGE.  There are spots for about 3 cars.&lt;/p&gt;

This cache is on public land, some to the left of trail may be private and posted. STAY SOUTH OF THE STREAM. From what I've gathered from town employees, the town has a 50 yard easement, or something like that, on that side of the creek. Use your own judgement if you should decide to cross the tape, the signs cross back over to the southside of the trail after 20 yards or so. An easy run.</groundspeak:short_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Noticed this one hasn't been found in over 4 months and in reading over the logs - looked like a nice challenge. I was right. It was raining slightly to add to the fun.  

The early part of the trail was taken over completely by overgrowth. I took my best guess and started bush whacking toward the prize. Wow this was thick stuff but only had to cross one minor stream staying south of the big creek as per the instructions. All signs of no trespassing have been removed so once I linked back into the trail it was easier going. The find was easy with coords spot on.  Hike back was easier but slowed again near the end due to no one going on these trails resulting in total takeover by nature. But I made it back in one (wet) piece. Fun find.

This is a new canister I am trying out. It fits something like 50
logs front and back. It is made to hold liquid so I assume it will
keep it out too! But we all know what happens when you assume, you
are often wrong! FTF Prize: Pirate Treasure!!! Congratulations to
TJ and MarD for grabbing the FTF only 17 minutes after it was
published! There was stiff competition!</groundspeak:long_description>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">KFC - Dwaaskill</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">When we first started caching in 2002 the caches were all regular
sized ammo cans, tupperware or similar sized containers. the kids
enjoyed taking fun walks in the woods and we enjoyed the
opportunity to get them outside having some fun. Although we love
the walks, to the kids the best part is finding the cache and
digging through to see what goodies are in the latest find.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Today there is a huge variety of caches and hiding styles - which
is great and makes the game even more fun. But this series is
designed for parents who want to take the kids out on a trail and
enjoy some family time with a prize at the end. Any time you see
one of our caches that starts with "KFC" - it will be a nice walk
on an easy trail with an easy to find cache at the end that the
kids can enjoy. Feel free to name your own "Kid Friendly Caches"
with a KFC in the name as well so others know yours is a cache the
kids will enjoy too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;KFC - Dwaaskill&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
KFC - Dwaaskill takes you to the Dwaaskill Preserve. This preserve
has several trails and a lot to see along the way including bird
houses, small bridges over streams and even a few relic cars
mysteriously located in the old woods.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is an easy find on a nice trail. Bikes are allowed but
may be tight in some areas. Have fun!</groundspeak:long_description>

Aww, isn't he cute?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is located at N42 53.ABC W73 47.DEF&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To find the cache, answer these questions:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A = Commonly referred to as a "panda ____", count letters in 2nd word&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
B = Count the letters of a panda's favorite treat and subtract 1&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
C = The number of zoos in the US you can see pandas at currently&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
D = The US generally pays China this many million dollars a year to have panda's at their zoos&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
E = The number of colors of a panda's fur&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
F = The number of letters of the country the panda is from&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As this one is very close to a trail, please make sure you re-hide this one completely. Have fun!

This probably isn't the best time of year to find the cache, as the trail is rather overgrown now (read: what trail?!).  Especially early in the morning after a night of rain.  I was soaked by the time I got back to the car, but we still very happy to find another puzzle cache.

In all the excitement I forgot to drop off a TB.  Hopefully I can find another non-micro sometime soon!

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">A small lock and lock container hidden in the Dwaaskill Nature Preserve. You will have a short (although it may be a muddy) walk to the cache.&lt;br /&gt;
**Please bring your own pen until I get a pen small enough to put in here**</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Just a few weeks ago, I was at the Dwaaskill finding a cache on my own. At the intersection of a trail, I ran into a lovely older couple and had a short talk with them. We talked about the trails back in here, and I mentioned that I was going out to find a geocache along the trail. They were not geocachers, but said they had heard of it before. They told me it was their first time in here, and they lived over in Niskayuna. After a few minutes, we parted and I went off to find the cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While heading back out of the preserve a while later, I passed the couple sitting down on the bridge, overlooking the stream eating lunch. The woman asked me if I found the cache, and then they asked me if I wanted some lunch too. It was very sweet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe the couple will start caching someday and see this tribute to them. If not, I'd like to remember them anyway for how kind they were. This cache is hidden near the place where the couple ate their lunch. Please be sure to re-hide it well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Found the cache and noticed the RTG on the log for today's date.  Sorry to have missed saying Hello.  At the entrance to the path there is quite a bit of growth and you feel as though you are walking through a garden trestle.  The path was wet as I expected this early in the morning and from other times that I have been in this area.  Found the geotrail that helped to locate the cache as my GPS didn't want to settle in the area (and gave me a reading of 20 feet off at GZ).  Cache and contents are in good shape.

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">After living in Jonesville for more than 40 years I wanted other people to enjoy the quaint village, hence, my Discover Historic Jonesville series.  The hamlet was named for the founder James Jones.  It was a stop on the early stagecoach route from Albany to Saratoga.  Many of the older homes still standing were built in the early 1800's.
The cache is in a local neighborhood park.  There is a parking lot on Main St. next to the tennis courts.  The park is open from 7am-10pm and is checked so nighttime caching is discouraged.  The idea of this cache is to trade recipes.  It will be stocked with copies of some of my favorite recipes.  Feel free to take a copy and to either leave a copy of one of yours or e-mail a recipe to me which I can make copies of and restock the cache.  It also holds trade items and has started with crayons, an activity book and head band for the little ones.</groundspeak:long_description>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This type of tank first arrived on the scene in 1960, and is actually still in service by some nations' military around the world today.  The US military has long since replaced it with more modern technology.  If you've never been up close to a real tank, it's definitely worth checking out.  

This cache is kid-friendly and easily accessible from the parking lot of the American Legion, but please be sure to treat the site with the utmost respect and honor that it deserves.  No climbing on the tank is required, so please be respectful.  The hide is not in the surrounding landscaping, so please do not look there either.  

Given the location and nature of the monument, please visit only during daylight hours.  The assigned difficulty reflects this constraint.  Please use stealth.

A crisp $1 bill awaits the lucky FTF.  I bet General Washington would have loved to have one of these tanks during his military days!

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RACNLA was driving me back to my car after our first setback at
Mondo Multi II. Our trek led us from Colonie to Latham to Clifton
Park, and Vischer's Ferry. From here the trip continued back
to my car at MMII's parking area. I led him past the
Vischer's Ferry Preserve and along Riverview Road, one of my
favorite alternate routes. Along the way I caught a glimpse of
something special and hastily marked a waypoint as Rick continued
on, oblivious to what I had seen and where I would one day come
back to play!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many like to place single caches to add to the smiley pleasure.
Me, I like to add to my diversity of caches placed, hence, this
area having two multi caches. Add to your caching smiley face
diversity by locating these two multi caches! Don't fret,
though, as I did not make them too hard for you to find. Even
RACNLA himself could find these, unlike a certain Clue cache I had
to help him locate!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do indeed think that is eltee1 I see over there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RACNLA was driving….(End of Part 2)…&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
During the non-frozen river times, this cache, and its accompanying
friend, can also be done from the river. This area also allows
river access to kayaks and canoes via portage.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: You, and all members of your party must read and
agree to the www.geocaching.com disclaimer. In addition, you all
must agree to hold the cache owner, www.geocaching.com, and the
landowners harmless from any and all causes for action. You and all
other members of your party must individually and collectively
determine your/their physical fitness and outdoors/hiking skill
levels, decide whether or not to visit the various cache locations,
and whether or not it is safe and prudent to do so under the
conditions that will be encountered. Cache seekers assume all risks
involved in seeking these cache locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People that do not wish to do a cache because of any danger they
might perceive to be present is certainly within their right to not
proceed. However you do not have the right to try to ruin the
enjoyment of others in attempting a find that is beyond your
capabilities, but not beyond theirs. This goes for almost every
caching event there is. After all one might run into spiders,
snakes, poisonous plants, broken glass, trips and falls and the
list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safety First! .......Take a friend, Look out for others, take a
cell phone if possible, watch where you're stepping, NEVER UNCOVER
ANY CACHE WITH YOUR HANDS OR FEET, USE A STICK! If you feel
uncomfortable in doing a cache, for any reason, just walk
away!!!&lt;/p&gt;

One of those days, I stopped and even brought caching supplies to place something!  Fortunately, I checked my phone for proximity before placing anything, and found that this one was really close.

Made every stage much more difficult than it needed to be, but eventually I came up with them!  The final in particular took forever!  This was a very nice area and one I would come back to for a picnic, cache or not!  TFTC!!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Between our funky GPSr that likes to point in the opposite direction and the brace on Frin's sprained knee, this was not a successful find.  Having read the logs that there would be a bit of bushwhacking, Frin followed Frak when he forged into the woods to the left of the playground. Of course the walking sticks were in the other car and Frin's knee was complaining bitterly by the time Frak noticed the path AND the needle decided to point in the right direction. We followed the path and came to where the needle did an eyes left. Frak decided to do the bushwhacking leaving Frin on the path as Frin noticed Carlton Road about 40-50 feet away. Holy Moly, they could have parked on the side of the road!  Of course there was a bit of needle bounce and spider webs, things that Frak hates.  Frin did make her way in but was having trouble with the undergrowth and we decided to leave this one until they could both look without falling on their faces.</groundspeak:text>
